Fortunately, this is about to get slightly easier.Bank of America is an incredibly complex organization. It has $2.2 trillion worth of assets on its balance sheet, offers many dozens of financial products and services, and oversees an additional $2.4 trillion worth of assets that are owned by clients.To top things off, it's long been the only major bank to use an esoteric accounting ruleto gauge the value of certain debt securities that are carried at fair value and held to maturity. Known as FAS 91, this has caused Bank of America's net revenue to fluctuate wildly on a quarter-to-quarter basis.In the most recent quarter, for instance, Bank of America reported net revenue of $20.6 billion under generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). But if you exclude the impact from FAS 91, as well as other similar adjustments, its revenue in the three months ended June 30 was $21.8 billion.This makes a huge difference. With the FAS 91 adjustment, Bank of America's revenue fell by $1.6 billion compared to the same quarter last year. Without the adjustment, it grew by roughly $100 million.The issue boils down, in particular, to the impact of interest rates on mortgage-backed securities. When rates rise, the value of these go up. When rates fall, MBS values do, too. But while most banks accounted for these changes in value over the life of the securities, FAS 91 required Bank of America to do so all at once in each accounting period.The net result was that it took an additional step for investors to accurately compare Bank of America's performance in any given quarter to that of its peers. And because interest rates have been on the decline essentially ever since the financial crisis eight years ago, it means that Bank of America's revenue and earnings suffered more than most from the trend.But this will no longer be the case. Bank of America announcedat the end of last week that it has decided to do away with FAS 91. It will now treat the impact of changing interest rates on the value of its securities in the same way that other banks do.It's a minor change that doesn't impact Bank of America's fundamentals. But it's nevertheless an adjustment that current and prospective investors in the nation's second-biggest bank by assets should welcome with open arms.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.After analysts and commentators had predicted an interest-rate hike for most of 2016, the Federal Reserve finally came through for them. The central bank concluded its latest monetary policy committee meeting on Wednesday by releasing a statement saying that it had decided to boost the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage points.This is great news for banks, which stand to make a lot more money when rates rise, and none more so than Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) .""In view of realized and expected labor market conditions and inflation, the Committee decided to raise the target range for the federal funds rate to 1/2 to 3/4 percent,"" says the Fed's press release. ""In determining the timing and size of future adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will assess realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation.""US Target Federal Funds Ratedata by YCharts.The move didn't come as a shock. Going into Wednesday, an analysis of Fed Fund futures prices, which gauge the market's view on changes in monetary policy, tagged the likelihood of an increase at 95%.Much of the optimism was tied to the fact that the unemployment figures for November were surprisingly good. The unemployment rate last month dropped to 4.6%, down from 4.9% in October. That's well below the Fed's 5% target and it's the lowest the unemployment rate has been since August 2007.US Unemployment Ratedata by YCharts.Another sign that the Fed's decision wasn't a surprise can be surmised from the fact that bank stocks barely budged today. Shares of JPMorgan Chasewere essentially flat, Bank of America closed 0.27% higher, and Citigroupwas down by 0.57%.The one exception among the nation's biggest bankswas Wells Fargo, which saw its share price drop by 2%. But that had less to do with interest rates, and more to do with the Fed's announcementafter the market closed on Tuesday that Wells Fargo had failed to remedy defects in its so-called living will that regulators had identified back in April -- click hereto read more about this.For investors in bank stocks who have waited patiently for rates to rise, this is unquestionably a positive development. One way to think about banks is that, by making loans, they effectively sell money. And interest rates are the price at which they do so. As rates rise, in turn, so too will bank profits.All banks will benefit from this trend, but Bank of America is positioned to benefit the most. According to its latest quarterly regulatory filing, its 10-Q, Bank of America's net interest income will increase by $5.3 billion over the next 12 months if short- and long-term rates rise by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point.Bank of America obviously won't see the entirety of that $5.3 billion in added net interest income just yet, given that the Fed boosted short-term rates by only a quarter of that amount. But the North Carolina-based bank will benefit from a portion of the increase. And even more importantly, the Fed's decision to hike rates is a clear signal that the economy is heading in the right direction.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

and being asked by your parent, ""Why do you want to do this""? 
A child would almost always reply, ""Because everyone else is.""Those familiar with this life lesson also know the next part of
the story where the parent replies, ""if everyone was jumping off a
bridge, would you want to also?""The Blind Leading the BlindOn 10/31 I wrote an article (
here

) entitled, ""What the Ultimate Contrarian Indicator is Saying"" that
called out Barron's and other magazine covers as excellent
contrarian indicators.The October 15 issue in Barron's Magazine indeed provided a
great contrarian sell signal for investors. ""Dow 14,165, Almost
There"" yelled the cover title when the Dow was at 13,325
(NYSEARCA:UDOW).  By the next month, the Dow was down 8%
(NYSEARCA:SDOW).  Still, after almost four months since that
cover story was published, the Dow (DJI:^DJI) has made little
progress pricewise and has put investors in the way of an 8%
(NYSEARCA:DIA) decline along the way.Magazine Covers and SentimentIn Technical Analysis this is called ""the cover of the magazine""
sentiment technique.  The theory is when the crowd consensus
becomes too lopsided one way, it is usually captured by a popular
media outlet such as magazines.  Often that side of the trade
is exhausted by the time the media gets a hold of it and the
opposite actually occurs.In this case, Barron's was capturing the consensus opinion that
the markets were poised to continue to rally.  However, we saw
it differently warning ETF Profit Strategy Newsletter subscribers
on 10/19 ""The lack of confirmation (of the uptrend) of market
internals such as breadth and sentiment continues.  We are
waiting for prices to maintain below the Fed support zone @ 1430
(NYSEARCA:SPY) to give us a signal an intermediate top is likely
in"".  On 10/23 that breach occurred saving investors a lot of
headaches as the market fell 8% from its high of 1475 (SNP:^GSPC)
down to 1343 on 11/16.Another Contrarian Sign?What about magazine covers now?Barron's recently released another bold call, this time on
Europe in its 12/24 cover story, ""EUROPE: Time to Buy"".As a contrarian it is interesting to me that Europe made the
cover page after an already 15% 2012 rally and a 33% (NYSEARCA:IEV)
rise from its June 2012 lows.But, Barron's is not alone in their 2013 predictions. 
""Europe in Better Shape than US"" was the article on 12/11 from CNBC
with strategists suggesting Europe's stocks looked better than U.S
companies in 2013.  Bank of America (
BAC

) agrees, ""The European Union and Asia (NYSEARCA:EEMA) will likely
produce returns between 10% and 16%"". The consensus is bullish
European stocks.OOPSThe time to put Europe (NYSEARCA:EEM) on its cover was likely
this past summer, after an 18% market decline, not after a 33%
rally.Alas! Barron's in fact did have Europe on its cover this past
summer, but unfortunately for them it was in the exact wrong
context.Barron's July cover focused on Europe's continued debt crisis
and included its cover shot of the Euro (NYSEARCA:FXE) at parity
with the U.S. dollar implying a European meltdown.  A Euro at
parity would mean a 20% fall from where it was when the story went
to press in July.The Euro has actually rallied 10% since that Barron's
article.When the media should have been bullish and looking for a trend
change they were predictably bearish, providing yet again another
contrarian signal.The Blind Leading the BlindGiven the consensus bullishness now surrounding Europe supported
by strategists, magazine covers, and all the big Wall Street banks,
and after an already strong 2012, we would be hesitant to buy into
the prevailing ""wisdom"" that Europe is the place to park your money
for 2013.  To us it sounds more like recency bias and
performance chasing.Technically, price has reached a momentum extreme at the same
time the Barron's cover article came out (not likely just a
coincidence) .  Momentum is also now diverging with
price.  A breakdown of a key trendline at $47 on the Vanguard
European VIPERS (NYSEARCA:VGK) would put the uptrend in serious
jeopardy likely setting up a technical sell signal.If price breaks the support, then Barron's and other
popular mainstream media outlets may once again prove that the
consensus can be a reliable contrarian indicator and a
good tool to use to help identify market turning points. That said,
magazine covers are best used in conjunction with other market
barometers, such as technical analysis, instead of as stand-alone
tools, since the timing of trend changes can sometimes take some
time.The

haven't been optimistic

about
Bank of America

's long-term success. But all of this changed when I looked
into the bank's
dramatic turnaround

in the mid-1980s.Thanks to double-digit inflation, a debt crisis throughout
Latin America, and general mismanagement, Bank of America
recorded three successive annual losses in the span from 1985
to 1987. Things got so bad for the nation's biggest bank by
assets at the time that analysts and commentators began
predicting its imminent demise

.But all of this changed as abruptly as it began. After
clearing its books of bad loans, auctioning off real estate and
non-core operating divisions, laying off thousands of
employees, and replacing both its chairman and CEO, Bank of
America's profits soared.It earned more money in 1988 than it had since its founding
84 years earlier. And things got better from there, with annual
net income by the mid-1990s that was four times larger than the
bank's peak pre-crisis performance.The lesson I learned from this experience, and from the
following chart in particular, is that, despite Warren
Buffett's dictum that ""
turnarounds seldom turn

,"" banks can in fact emerge from a potentially existential
crisis in bigger and better shape than ever before.Of course, as bad as the 1980s were for banks, the
financial crisis of 2008-2009

was worse. But while this may lead one to conclude that Bank of
America's experience three decades ago shouldn't be used to
assess its prospects today, I disagree.Even though the latest crisis was the worst economic
cataclysm since the Great Depression, Bank of America arguably
fared better through it than it did in the mid-1980s. It
reported only a single annual loss over the past decade
compared to three successive annual losses in the prior
period.Additionally, while it's true that Bank of America barely
survived the seizure of credit markets after the housing bubble
burst, not to mention the
onerous legal costs

that followed, it has emerged as a bigger and more diversified
bank than ever before thanks to its
shotgun marriage to Merrill Lynch

in 2008.Lastly, now that Bank of America's outstanding legal
liabilities are
tapering off

and the lions' share of its credit losses are also in the
rearview mirror, its bottom line is finally set to soar. We saw
this in the
latest quarter

when the bank earned a 0.99% return on assets, which is just
below the 1% threshold that has long been associated with the
nation's most profitable banks.The net result is that Bank of America's profit, and thus
its share price, may finally be set to recover as radically as
it did in the late-1980s and early-1990s.This $19 trillion industry could destroy the
Internet


One bleeding-edge technology is about to put the World Wide
Web to bed. And if you act quickly, you could be among the
savvy investors who enjoy the profits from this stunning
change. Experts are calling it the single largest business
opportunity in the history of capitalism...

Bank of America

(NYSE: BAC) perform in the second quarter? This seems like a
straightforward question, but the answer is: It depends. Namely,
it depends on whether you're talking about the North
Carolina-based bank's actual or adjusted earnings.If you look at Bank of America's actual earnings, you'd be led
to believe that it had a miserable quarter. The nation's second
biggest bank by assets earned $0.36 per share on a GAAP basis,
which equates to a 16% decline from the year-ago period, when it
earned $0.43 per share.This isn't because Bank of America had a sharp increase in
expenses. Its operating costs on a year-over-year basis dropped
by $465 million. And while its credit costs increased by $196
million, this was more than offset by the decline in operating
expenses.The issue lies in Bank of America's revenue, and specifically
the amount of money it earns from its asset portfolios. Its net
interest income in the second quarter came out to $9.2 billion.
By contrast, in the second quarter of last year, the figure was
$10.5 billion.If you're looking for the reason Bank of America's GAAP
earnings fell by $900 million, in turn, it's because the bank's
net interest income declined by more than $1.2 billion.But even though this helps explain why Bank of America's
reported earnings fell compared with the year-ago period, it's
still only a partial explanation. To understand the issue fully,
it's important to appreciate that not all of Bank of America's
interest-earning assets generated less revenue.In fact, its loan portfolio earned $264 million more interest
income than it did in the same period last year. The negative
impact came instead from a $1.6 billion year-over-year reduction
in interest income from Bank of America's securities portfolio,
and specifically from its holdings of mortgage-backed
securities.These are a common but peculiar type of security. Like bonds,
they're backed by debt -- namely, mortgages. But unlike a bond,
the value of which is inversely correlated to interest rates
(when rates go down, bond prices go up), a mortgage-backed
security loses some of its allure when interest rates decline, as
they did last quarter.Lower interest rates give people incentive to refinance their
mortgages, which means they pay off the loans held in the
mortgage-backed security. This decreases the interest income the
security produces. People in the financial industry refer to this
as prepayment risk.When this happens, a bank can account for the impact on its
portfolio of mortgage-backed securities in one of two ways. It
can reduce the amount of money it earns from the portfolio as
prepayments come to fruition, or it can record a one-time charge
that accounts for the anticipated drop in interest income in one
fell swoop.You can see the impact from the two methods by comparing
Wells Fargo

with Bank of America. Wells Fargo, which follows the first
method, recorded a $24 million year-over-year increase in
interest income from its securities portfolio last quarter. That
compares to the already-noted $1.6 billion decrease at Bank of
America.Importantly, the disparity in this regard is superficial. It
reflects a difference in accounting principles, not fundamental
performance.Given this, in addition to reporting GAAP earnings, Bank of
America reports an adjusted earnings figure that backs out the
somewhat idiosyncratic way it accounts for interest rate
fluctuations. And it's this figure, as opposed to its GAAP
earnings, that more accurately reflects Bank of America's
performance in any given quarter.QuarterNet Interest Income (As Reported)Net Interest Income (Excluding Market-Related
Adjustments)Q2 2016$9.2 billion$10.4 billionQ1 2016$9.2 billion$10.6 billionQ4 2015$9.8 billion$10.5 billionQ3 2015$9.5 billion$10.3 billionQ2 2015$10.5 billion$10.0 billionData source: Bank of America.When you look at Bank of America's adjusted earnings for the
second quarter, things look a lot better. After excluding the
market-related adjustment to its net interest income, the $2.2
trillion bank earned $0.42 per share in the three months ended
June 30. And if you do the same thing to its earnings in the
second quarter of last year, they come out to $0.40 per
share.Thus, while it's tempting to think that Bank of America earned
less money last quarter than it did in the year-ago period, the
truth is that it actually earned more. This helps to explain why
the bank's shares are up 5% in the wake of its earnings report.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

The Wall Street Journal

,
Bank of America Corporation

(
BAC

) is planning to layoff nearly 16,000 jobs by the end of the
current year as a part of its cost-cutting efforts in order to
boost top-line growth. The estimated headcount following the job
cuts would be nearly 260,000, the lowest since 2008.BofA plans to dismiss nearly 5,300 employees in consumer-banking
and 3,200 in the unit that manages new mortgages. Also, reductions
are expected in a unit that supervises troubled loans. Moreover, it
is planning to shut down 200 branches in the current year. Last
year, the company closed down 178 branches.The job cuts are part of its 'Project New BAC'- the efficiency
improvement initiative launched by the bank to rationalize its
operations and shed its non-core assets. The ongoing measures to
enhance the performance reflect BofA's constant struggle to
overcome dodging issues of a weak economy, a low interest rate
environment, legal hassles as well as losses at its mortgage
unit.BofA aims at simplifying its business structure and building a
sound capital position. The bank has already made many changes in
its consumer and small banking business, credit card operations,
home lending as well as global operations and also altered certain
support areas for backing its cost reduction plans.BofA anticipates that two phases of the 'Project New BAC' will
result in $8 billion in yearly savings by 2015 - $5 billion from
the first phase and $3 billion from a second phase that focuses on
the commercial bank, the investment bank and wealth management
business.Majority of the global banks are struggling to control costs
amidst the Eurozone crisis and gloomy macro-economic factors.
Several banks - such as
Citigroup, Inc.

(
C

),
HSBC Holdings plc

(
HBC

),
The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc

(
RBS

) - have significantly trimmed down their workforce as part of
cost-cutting measures.However, BofA's efforts to slash workforce outpace others by a
significant margin. The reduction of employment will put the
company below its peers - namely
JPMorgan Chase & Co.

(
JPM

) and
Wells Fargo & Company

(
WFC

) - in terms of employment.BofA seems to be a year ahead of schedule in trimming down
nearly 30,000 jobs. This reflects the company's sincere efforts to
return to its pre-recession glory. Given the near-term dismal
outlook for the economy and stringent regulatory landscape, most of
the banks will take up cost-cutting measures vigorously to maintain
a sound capital buffer to withstand any financial crisis.However, with so much job losses, unemployment rate could worsen
and the economic recovery will be at stake.Currently, BofA retains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a
short-term Hold rating. Considering the fundamentals, we also
maintain a long-term Neutral recommendation on the stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Investing,Business,Stocks","BAC","[{'news_title': '2 Ways Public-Private Partnerships Are Spurring Economic Development', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/2-ways-publicprivate-partnerships-are-spurring-economic-development-cm944314', '_id': {'$oid': '5ac80d773efc2c417986fafa'}}, {'news_title': 'Should You Reward Employees In The Wake Of The Tax Bill?', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/should-you-reward-employees-in-the-wake-of-the-tax-bill-cm943488', '_id': {'$oid': '5ac80d773efc2c417986fafb'}}, {'news_title': 'Avoid These 7 Financial Mistakes Says CEO Of $175M  Company', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/avoid-these-7-financial-mistakes-says-ceo-of-175m-company-cm942559', '_id': {'$oid': '5ac80d773efc2c417986fafc'}}]","{'$date': '2012-09-20T17:34:09Z'}"

A perfect example is Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) .Bank of America's headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: Getty Images.Over the past three months, Bank of America's shares have climbed by 35%, making it one of the top performers in the bank industry. The KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap bank stocks, is up only 22% over the same stretch. You'd be excused for concluding that Bank of America's stock must thereby have the most to lose if the promised regulatory rollback comes up short of expectations, which could very well happen.BACdata by YCharts.Indeed, if you listen to Gary Cohn, one of Trump's chief economic advisors, the administration doesn't intend to wage a direct attack on the Dodd-Frank Act. This is because getting a comprehensive overhaul through Congress would be next to impossible. The votes just aren't there in the Senate, where the Republicans have only a slim majority but would need 60 votes to enact sweeping changes.The administration is instead going to focus on easing existing regulations by changing out personnel at the agencies in charge of overseeing banks, says Cohn. By changing governors at the Federal Reserve, for instance, the administration could make it a lot easier for banks to distribute capital to shareholders -- a development that Bank of America has been pining for. This would be a welcome development for banks, and Bank of America in particular, but it'd nevertheless come up short of a broad overhaul of Dodd-Frank.If a bill were to make its way through Congress, moreover, there's no guarantee it'd be as good for banks as many people seem to think. The most complete alternative to date, the Financial CHOICE Act proposed by Republican Representative Jeb Hensarling, would actually raise capital requirements for banks. Holding all else equal, that would further weigh on profitability in the sector.But even if investors are too optimistic about the extent of a regulatory overhaul, that doesn't mean that Bank of America's stock has climbed to unreasonable heights in anticipation of deregulation. Yes, it's gone up. And yes, expectations about a less-hostile regulatory environment have played into its rally. But Bank of America's shares are still reasonably valued.Most bank stocks will trade for a moderate premium to book value. This makes sense when you consider that bank investors aren't just buying a share of a bank's capital -- they're also staking a claim in that capital's ability to generate earnings.The average stock on the KBW Bank Index trades for a 45% premiumto book value. Bank of America, on the other hand, trades for a 5% discountto book value, according to data from YCharts.com. There are reasons for this: Bank of America's profitability has yet to fully recover from the financial crisis. But those reasons will dissipate with time. And as they do, Bank of America's valuation should converge with the average of its peer group.The net result is that Bank of America's shares seem, to me, to be reasonably priced, whether a massive regulatory overhaul comes to fruition or not.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

It acquired regional banks, a major credit card company, a trust company, and a huge investment bank, among others, often paying a substantial premiumto their market values at the time. By the late 1990s, it had become the first bank in the United States to have a coast-to-coast branch network.This obsession with growth irrespective of cost sounds bad, and particularly in the bank industry where rapid growth often leads to an equally rapid downfall, but there was method to Bank of America's madness. Its growth came at a time when the bank industry was transforming from a highly fragmented industry, where banks were prohibited from operating across state lines, into a coherent national market. The window of opportunity to lead this charge was brief, and Bank of America stepped into the void to do so.It was this ravenous ascent that created the Bank of America we know today. Had it not taken the initiative, it would have either been gobbled up by another bank that did or it would have been left in the dust by competitors who grasped hold of the opportunity to surge ahead of their peers at a critical inflection point for the industry.But there was a downside to Bank of America's strategy, too. Its purchase of credit card giant MBNA in 2005 exposed it to tens of billions of dollars' worth of charge-offsthree years later. And its 2008 acquisitions of Countrywide Financial and Merrill Lynch had a similar result, serving as the driving force behind Bank of America's $200 billionbill to extract itself from the financial crisis.Given that Moynihan has spent the last seven years overseeing Bank of America's costly extraction from the 2008 crisis, it should come as no surprise that he views the bank's former strategy skeptically.Time and again throughout his tenure, the 57-year-old executive has reassured shareholders that the bank's acquisitive ways are in the past. This dates back to his interview in 2009 for the job of CEO, when he promised the board of directors that the bank would ""forget all acquisitions, now and forever,"" as Fortune's Shawn Tully explainedin a 2011 profile of Moynihan.Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America.Instead, Bank of America would focus on two interrelated objectives: returning capital to shareholdersand chipping away at the 7 billion shares of common stock it issued during the financial crisis that so egregiously diluted shareholders and explains why its stock is still down more than 50% compared to its pre-crisis high.As Tully wrote six years ago:When BofA has built up a sufficient capital cushion, probably two to three years from now, Moynihan plans to return all earnings to investors in dividends or share buybacks -- we're talking about $25 billion a year, all stuffing shareholders' pockets. 'We need to get back most of the shares we issued in the crisis, that caused all the dilution,' says Moynihan.Bank of America has made progress on this front, though not as quickly as it would like. Over the past four years, it has repurchased $12.4 billion worth of common stock, working its outstanding share count down from 11.6 billion shares at the peak to 11 billion shares today. And it would have almost certainly bought back more, if not for the Federal Reserve's veto power over big bank capital plans.Lest there be any doubt about Moynihan's continued commitment to this strategy, he dedicated a significant portion of his shareholder letter this year to doubling down on it. He discussed the crisis-era dilution at length, the bank's efforts to offset it by buying back stock, and his desire to increase Bank of America's dividend, which has only happened twice in the past eight years.It was after this windup that Moynihan shared four lessons the bank learned from its experience over the past decade, with the first lesson speaking to his commitment to eschew acquisitions in favor of organic growth:First, we must grow organically. Acquisitions are not part of our strategy so we don't have to issue shares.Second, our businesses generate more than sufficient capital to fund their growth. We have shed non-core businesses and we have everything we need to serve our clients, so we can focus on building stronger relationships with them and optimizing returns.Third, we need to continue to reduce the number of shares outstanding. This is essential if we want our stock price to exceed the record highs we have achieved in our market capitalization and in our tangible book value per share. And, because our stock is trading at a price that is close to our book value, repurchasing shares now creates long-term value for remaining shareholders when we buy from the selling shareholders at this level.Finally, by staying focused on these things, and executing our strategy of responsible growth, we can deliver the returns that you expect from us and continue to return excess capital to you through dividends and common stock repurchases.To be fair, even if Bank of America wanted to go out and make acquisitions, it couldn't. Federal law prohibits a bank that holds 10% or more of the nation's deposits, as Bank of America does, from buying other banks. Moynihan discussed this in an interview last year, which you can read about here.But even if it were cleared to make acquisitions, Moynihan's strategy is the most prudent course for the $2.2 trillion bank to pursue. The successful banks of the future will spend their money not on buying other banks but rather on technology and adapting to an evolving customer base, stuffed with a new generation of consumers with less need or appreciation for bank branches. In short, as Moynihan knows better than anyone, Bank of America's acquisitive strategy of yore is outdated.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Here are the five most important points made on the call by CEO Brian Moynihan and CFO Paul Donofrio.As a global systemically important bank, Bank of America is subject to stricter capital requirements than regional and community banks. Among other things, it must hold an additional tranche of capital, known as the G-SIB buffer, the size of which is determined by Bank of America's size and complexity.According to Bank of America's latest quarterly regulatory filing, its G-SIB buffer at the end of the third quarter was 3%. Fast forward to the fourth quarter and that dropped to 2.5%. As Moynihan explained:After reviewing our year-end calculation and through the hard work of our teams, we are pleased to report that our method 2 G-SIB capital ratio requirement has dropped 50 basis points. So, our total 2019 CET 1 requirement is now 9.5%, instead of 10%.It's no secretthat higher interest rates will boost Bank of America's earnings. But now that rates have begun to rise, how much additional income can investors expect the North Carolina-based bank to earn?Bank of America's fourth-quarter resultswere only marginally impacted by higher rates, as both short- and long-term rates didn't increase until late in the quarter. The real benefit, says Moynihan, will come this quarter -- i.e., the first quarter of 2017 -- when Bank of America expects to earn $600 million more in net interest income from the surge in short- and long-term rates:But now we see rate increases in the fourth quarter of '16 in the latter part of the quarter on both the long end and the short end. As these rate increases were late in the quarter, they didn't benefit the fourth quarter NII number that's significant, but we look forward to first quarter '17 when we expect NII to grow, all things remaining equal, by approximately $600 million per quarter despite having two less days in that first quarter.Bank of America is one of the most asset sensitivebig banks, meaning that its earnings are especially sensitive to changes in interest rates. Before rates moved up last quarter, the bank estimated that a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates would translate into $5.3 billion worth of additional net interest income in the 12 months following the increase.This estimate no longer holds true. As the presentationaccompanying the conference call discloses, a further 100-basis-point increase in rates would translate into an added $3.4 billion worth of net interest income over 12 months. Most of that (75%) would come from higher short-term rates, with the remaining 25% from higher long-term rates.Earlier this year, as part of the stress test, Bank of America got approval from regulators to repurchase $5 billion worth of stock through the middle of this year. That number is now going up.On the call, Moynihan announced that the bank has added another $1.8 billion to its repurchase authorization. It did so by using the so-called de minimis exception, which allows banks to supplement previously announced buybacks by as much as 1% of a bank's high-quality capital:This morning and as part of our release, we announced that we got approval for de minimis of $1.8 billion, that's the $2.5 billion we have for the first half of this year to bring the repurchased volume to $4.3 billion for the first half year. So we applied to that obviously in December and got the approval and our Board has approved it.Like most other large banks, Bank of America is aggressively trying to reduce its branch count. It's able to do so because a growing share of its customers prefer to use its smartphone app for routine banking needs.None of this means, however, that Bank of America's branches are going away anytime soon. As Donofrio noted on the call:I think as you look at -- think about that number, my focus on the active mobile users, because that's going to be the interplay here. Active mobile users were up 16% year-over-year. On a big base, we grew active mobile users more than we grew in 2015. Mobile deposit transactions are now 19% of all deposit transactions, that's the equivalent of 880 financial centers, but -- so that's -- on the one hand, that says maybe you can optimize a little more, but on the other hand, as I said in the lead in, we still have 1 million people, almost 1 million people coming to the branch every day and they need that channel. They need it to transact some of them. But a lot of them come in for advice and we want them to do that. So, we need a certain footprint of financial centers.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This is good news for bank stocks, and Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) in particular, which stands to generate more revenue over the next 12 months if the central bank does so.Roughly half of a big and well-diversified bank's net revenue comes from interest payments on loans and bonds. Because of this, it's axiomatic that higher interest rates will translate into higher revenue.You can get a sense for how much a rate hike will help Bank of America by looking at its latest quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In it, the North Carolina-based bank estimates the impact on its net interest income from a 100 basis point increase in short-term rates, long-term rates, and both short- and long-term rates combined, respectively.Here's how this breaks down:Change in RatesAdditional Net Interest Income Over the Next 12 Months*Short-term rates: +100 basis points$3.1 billionLong-term rates: +100 basis points$4.5 billionShort- and long-term rates: +100 basis points$7.5 billion*These figures have changed slightly over the last three months, but based on statements from Bank of America's executives on its latest earnings call, they're still a relatively accurate approximation for how higher rates will impact the bank's top line. Data source: Bank of America's Q2 2016 10-Q, page 107.This is helpful information, but it's nevertheless important to appreciate that it's unlikely the Fed will raise rates by 100 basis points in one fell swoop. It's instead more likely to do so by 25 basis points, just as it did at its final meeting in 2015. Moreover, the Fed's monetary policy has the most potent impact on short-term rates.Given this, the most pertinent question for investors right now is: How much will a 25 basis point boost to short-term rates help Bank of America?Fortunately, thanks to an analyst's question about this very thing on Bank of America's third-quarter conference call, we have a pretty good idea. Here's the relevant exchange:Analyst:Can you help us try to translate your 100-basis-point rate sensitivity into something closer to what one Fed hike might do for your net interest income?Paul Donofrio, CFO of Bank of America:Sure. I can help you through that. So if you look about a 25-basis-point increase, that would be one quarter of our $5.3 billion in sensitivity.If you want to assume that 25 basis points increases the long end by 25 basis points you know the answer. You can roughly take a quarter of it, perhaps even a little bit more, because we're probably more asset sensitive on the first 25 than the last 25 of that 100.But if you don't want to increase on the long end just look at the short end. We've disclosed it's $3.3 billion. You can divide that by four and get a pretty good sense of what 25 basis points would do over the subsequent 12 months.In other words, assuming that the Federal Reserve raises short-term rates by 25 basis points before the end of the year, then Bank of America would earn something like $825 million more over the next year in net interest income. That would translate into an approximately 2% boost to its net interest income given the run-rate from its most recent quarter.That isn't enough to return Bank of America to its glory days prior to the financial crisis, but it'd certainly be a welcome development for investors who have long pined for the bank's profitability to improve.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

It has long since turned the corner on the financial crisis, its share price doubled in the past year, and now the icing on the cake: Warren Buffett called out the North Carolina-based bank in his latest letterto the shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) .In 2011, Berkshire Hathaway became one of Bank of America's biggest investors. The Buffett-led conglomerate purchased $5 billion worth of preferred stock at the time, which came with warrants to purchase 700 million shares of common stock for $7.14 a share at any time before the middle of 2021.Warren Buffett, chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Image source: The Motley Fool.The preferred stock in and of itself was a good deal, yielding 6%, or $300 million a year in annual dividend payments. But it's the warrants to purchase Bank of America common stock that have turned out to be extraordinarily lucrative.At today's share price, Berkshire's warrants are worth $12.2 billion. If you add that to the $5 billion in preferred stock plus the dividends that have been paid on that stake, that means Berkshire's investment in Bank of America has nearly quadrupledin less than six years.One of the questions the situation raises is this: When will Buffett exercise Berkshire's warrants, and how will he do so? Will he just sell the warrants or will he convert them into shares of common stock?In Buffett's annual letter, released on Saturday, he provided some insight. He first noted that Berkshire Hathaway could use its preferred stock to satisfy the $5 billion cost of exercising the warrants -- 700 million shares times $7.14 a share equals just under $5 billion.He then went on to note, however, that whether Berkshire exchanges its preferred stock will depend on Bank of America's dividend at that time:If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock -- now 30 cents annually -- should rise above 44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common. If the common dividend remains below 44 cents, it is highly probable that we will exercise the warrant immediately before it expires.This makes sense because an annual dividend of $0.44 a share, on a basis of $7.14 a share, equates to a 6.1% yield, which is slightly higher than the yield Berkshire earns from its stake in Bank of America's preferred stock.Beyond that, Buffett went on to seemingly prod Bank of America to continue buying back stock:Many of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quite aggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases been underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.From this, it's clear that Buffett is focused not only on Bank of America's underlying operations but also on the way it allocates capital. This happens to be Buffett's strongest skill set, and it also happens to be the force behind some of the best corporate returns over the past half-century, as William Thorndike lays out inThe Outsiders .For investors today, it's tempting to blindly follow Buffett's lead into companies like Bank of America. But keep in mind that he purchased the stake at the nadir of the bank's post-financial crisis problems, and that its shares have since roughly quadrupled in price. That isn't to say Bank of America's isn't a good buy at today's price, but it's nowhere near as cheap as it was when Buffett piled into the stock nearly six years ago.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A shares) When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Bank of America

. As a result, while headlines will continue to question the
decision to appoint CEO Brian Moynihan as chairman of the
board, shareholders in the nation's second biggest bank by
assets should ignore this noise and focus instead on the bank's
rapidly accelerating turnaround

.I don't want to spend too much of your time discussing the
upcoming shareholder vote

on splitting the CEO/chairman roles at Bank of America, but it
merits a conversation because it's the main storyline
circulating about the bank right now. Shareholders voted in
2009 to split the role of chairman and CEO. The positions were
held at the time by Ken Lewis, a journeyman executive who
ascended the ranks at Bank of America's predecessor company,
NationsBank

. The vote was in response to the bank's losses in 2008 and
2009, most of which were inherited from its 2008 acquisition of
Countrywide Financial.Shareholders were right to be mad. Bank of America not only
went hat in hand to the federal government for funds to absorb
the losses, it also egregiously diluted shareholders to raise
capital. Even today, its share price is 70% below its
pre-crisis high as a consequence of these moves.BAC

data by
YCharts

.Fast forward to the end of 2014, and the board of directors
rejoined the roles of chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan emerging
with both. This came across as an affront to shareholders
because (1) they hadn't been consulted in the decision and (2)
they had previously voted to separate the positions. In
response to pressure from Institutional shareholders, Bank of
America is giving investors another opportunity to vote on the
issue later this month -- on Sept. 22.Importantly, this vote
isn't a referendum

on Moynihan's performance; it's a reflection rather of the
board's poor judgment to move unilaterally. The 55-year-old
executive has done a commendable job leading the bank through
the worst five years of its existence. He's sold dozens of
subsidiaries to simplify the bank and raise capital. He's
closed more than 1,300 branches. He's reduced quarterly
operating expenses by more than $2 billion. He's slayed the
lion's share of legal liabilities faced by the bank. He's even
gained the support of Warren Buffett.Here's the Oracle of Omaha
addressing this point

a few years ago (emphasis added):I think [Moynihan] got handed a terrible situation, with
all of the problems -- particularly of Countrywide more than
anything else, but some of their own, too. So he was handed a
mess. [...] And what he has done is he's working through the
problems he inherited, and you can't do them in a day or in a
week or a month, particularly ones that involve litigation.
He's pared off some of the assets that aren't central to it.
He's done exactly what I would do if I was in there.Furthermore, a handful of recent developments show that the
progress made under Moynihan is yielding results which will
translate into higher profits:All three major credit rating agencies
increased

Bank of America's debt rating in the second quarter. More
upgrades could reduce its cost of funds by as much as $2
billion a year.A
legal decision

handed down in July reduced its outstanding legal liabilities
by $7.6 billion, and staunched the inflow of new claims.And the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller
of Currencies
announced

on Thursday that Bank of America would be given additional
autonomy in the capital planning process. This is a huge step
forward for a firm that's struggled in three of the last five
stress tests

.My point is this: The intense focus on the upcoming
shareholder vote has masked the acceleration of Bank of
America's
turnaround

. Shareholders who see through this noise stand to make a lot
of money. But investors who can't get past it will likely be
left on the sidelines as the bank's share price soars in the
months and years ahead.The next billion-dollar iSecret

But the rally is in fact the reason analysts are lowering their ratings, as the bank's shares are no longer as cheap as they were before the post-election surge.BACdata by YCharts.Analyst David George at Robert W. Baird published a note to clients this week urging them to ""take profits and selectively reduce exposure"" to Bank of America. He also downgraded its stock from outperform to neutral, though he belatedly boosted his price target by $1 to $18 per share. To put that in perspective, Bank of America's stock is trading for just over $20 a share right now.Baird's move came on the heels of Guggenheim's downgrade of Bank of America's stock the prior day. Analysts at Guggenheim also believe that the bank's share price has gotten too rich, prompting them to change their rating from buy to neutral.Finally, analyst Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bankreduced his rating on Bank of America from buy to hold. Notably, O'Connor downgraded the North Carolina-based bank on the day of the election -- that is, before it went on to surge by 18%. Bad timing, but it could happen to anyone in this business.The point to note is that all of these analysts think Bank of America's shares no longer have as much upside as they did before the election. That's obviously true. A stock that traded for $17 two weeks ago is much more attractive than the same stock that trades for $20 today.Investors shouldn't interpret any of these downgrades to mean that it's time to sell their stake in the nation's second biggest bank by assets. For a variety of reasons I've discussed over the past week -- here, here, and here-- shareholders in Bank of America can still be optimistic.The likelihood that interest rates will soon rise, coupled with the incoming administration's promise to ease regulations on the industry, will serve as a potent stimulant to bank profits. These forces could also free Bank of America up to boost its dividend by a substantial degree.It's worth noting as well that even though Bank of America's shares are certainly more expensive than they were two weeks ago, they're by no means egregiously overvalued.They trade for less than 13 times forward earnings. That's well below the average stock on the S&P 500, which trades for 18 times forward earnings. Bank of America's shares also trade for a reasonable 17% premium to its tangible book value. There will come a day when that seems cheap, as bank stocks tend to trade for two or more times book value at the top of a cycle.In sum, investors in Bank of America needn't be worried about analysts' recent downgrades. Its shares are still reasonably priced with room to run.Forget the 2016 Election: 10 stocks we like better than Bank of AmericaDonald Trump was just elected president, and volatility is up.

's stock is a
bargain at today's price

, but you should only buy or hold shares in the nation's
second-biggest bank by assets if you're comfortable with
volatility. The recent past offers a case in point.Last month, China's central bank
devalued the yuan

in order to prop up its struggling economy and financial
markets. This triggered elevated volatility in stocks in the
United States, as traders and investors fretted over what a
recession in China might mean for global economic growth.But while the S&P 500 oscillated wildly, shares of Bank
of America moved even more violently. You can see this in the
chart below, which compares the daily change in Bank of
America's stock to the S&P 500 on the 10 most volatile
trading days since the beginning of August. (For the record,
the chart shows the absolute value of the daily changes,
meaning that both upward and downward movements are expressed
in positive numbers.)During these 10 days, Bank of America's stock moved by an
average of 3.4%. The S&P 500, by contrast, moved by an
average of only 2.6% during the same stretch.This relationship is captured by Bank of America's ""
beta

,"" which compares how much a single stock moves relative to the
broader market on any given day. A stock with a beta of 1.0
should closely track the market. A stock with a beta that
exceeds 1.0 moves more than the market on a daily basis. And a
stock with a beta that's less than 1.0 is less volatile than
the broader market.Bank of America's beta, according to
Finviz.com

, is 1.8. This means it's roughly 80% more volatile than the
typical stock.Why is this? The answer has to do with Bank of America's
daily trading volume -- that is, the number of shares that are
traded on an average day. As you can see below, the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based bank is the most heavily traded stock on
the S&P 500, outpacing runner-up
Apple

by 29%.Bank of America's share price, and the issues it has faced
since the
financial crisis

, also play into this. Because its stock ($16 per share) costs
less than, say, the iPhone maker's ($112 per share), it's
particularly affordable for hedge funds and individual
investors to trade in and out of. Additionally, the constant
stream of news related to the $2.2 trillion bank causes traders
to buy and sell its stock more frequently than less-newsworthy
companies.You can get a sense for this in the final chart below, which
shows what happened to Bank of America's average daily trading
volume once the crisis hit, causing its share price to plummet,
and igniting the
media firestorm

that the bank has faced ever since.Thus, to repeat, while I believe that Bank of America's
shares are cheap at today's price, investors need to appreciate
that future gains will come at the expense of elevated
volatility in the present.The next billion-dollar iSecret

Chart by author.Whenever you're looking at a company's stock to invest in, one
of the first questions you should ask yourself is: How does the
company make money?Asking this will help to hone your sense for whether the
company at issue has a sustainable business model; it'll also
help get your mind around the types of things that will cause the
company's revenue to increase or decrease in any given
quarter.With this in mind, I opened
Bank of America

's(NYSE: BAC) 
2015 10-K

to see how its revenue broke down by source last year. All told,
as you can see in the chart at the top of this article, the
nation's second biggest bank by assets generates revenue in eight
principle ways:Net interest income:

Earned by borrowing money from depositors and other wholesale
fund providers and then investing that money in higher-yielding
interest-earning assets.Asset management and brokerage fees:

Earned principally by Bank of America's Merrill Lynch and U.S.
Trust subsidiaries, which manage customer assets, such as
individual retirement accounts, and generate revenue from
transaction fees in brokerage accounts.Service charges:

These consist of fees on deposit accounts, such as account
fees, overdraft fees, nonsufficient funds fees, etc.Trading:

Earned in Bank of America's investment bank principally by
making markets for clients that are institutional investors --
i.e., hedge funds, pension funds, and insurance companies,
among others.Card income:

Earned from credit card related charges, including interchange
income (a.k.a. ""swipe"" fees), account fees, late fees, and so
on.Investment banking:

Fees earned from taking companies public, issuing debt
securities for clients, and advising on mergers and
acquisitions.Mortgage banking:

Just as it sounds, this is related to the origination,
servicing, and sale of mortgages and home equity loans.Investment gains:

Earned when Bank of America sells an asset/investment for more
than it bought it for.Speaking very generally, there are two things to point out
here. First, a large plurality of Bank of America's revenue comes
from its portfolio of interest-earning assets. This is why
interest rates are the single most important variable that play
into Bank of America's profitability -- higher rates equate to
higher profits.And second, each of these categories is subject to its own
unique set of levers. For instance, Bank of America's asset
management and brokerage fees stem principally from the value of
its assets under management as well as from the volume of client
stock trades. Meanwhile, its card income is driven by the number
of outstanding credit card accounts (this drives annual fees)
combined with purchasing volume (which drives interchange
income).In sum, there's a lot of moving pieces here, but for the
astute investor with time on their hands, breaking down Bank of
America's revenue streams like this, and then analyzing each of
the component parts, can go a long way toward helping you
determine whether the bank's stock is a viable long-term
investment.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

A multitude of factors no doubt played into the decline, but there are two in particular that seem to be the primary culprits.Analysts at Citigroupopined this week that investor confidence in the incoming presidential administration may be waning. An index that attempts to capture this, the News Implied Sentiment Indicator, has reversed most of its post-election climb.The metric, which measures the number of Bloomberg News stories that contain the words ""bullish"" and ""bearish,"" is a crude metric to be sure. But there could certainly be something to it -- at least in the case of bank stocks.Shares of the nation's biggest banks surged in the wake of the presidential election. A Republican-controlled federal government combined with promises made by the incoming administration on the campaign trail to roll back regulations and accelerate economic growth by way of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, persuaded investors that banks could soon start to earn a lot more money.BACdata by YCharts.Few banks stand to benefit as much as Bank of America, which has seen its stock climb 30% over the past two months. Higher interest rates spurred by raster economic growth would boost Bank of America's top and bottom lines more than any other major bank. Moreover, because of its missteps leading up to the financial crisis, the North Carolina-based bank has been under the watchful eye of regulators ever since. This has driven up its compliance costs and impeded its ability to return capital to shareholders.The question now is whether investors were too optimistic that the new President will be able to deliver on his campaign vows. The answer to this remains to be seen, but the sharp decline in bank stocks Tuesday, coupled with Citigroup's analysis of investor sentiment, suggests that investors are dialing back their expectations.The second piece of news that seems to have weighed on Bank of America's stock on Tuesday relates to the Supreme Court. The court refused to hear an appeal by the bank, joined by Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, challenging antitrust lawsuits accusing the banks of conspiring to rig a key short-term interest rate benchmark, the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, going back decades.The ruling leaves Bank of America and other banks vulnerable to potentially billions of dollars' worth of damages suffered by investor who held securities tied to Libor. ""The wrong result here could be economically devastating,"" argued the banks.The case could still be dismissed or settled, but the added uncertainty is never a good thing for stocks. In sum, I still believe that Bank of America is a very good stock to own for the long run, but the road is bound to be bumpy.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.A lot of people own Bank of America's(NYSE: BAC) stock -- it is, after all, the most heavily traded stockon the S&P 500. But shares of the nation's second biggest bank by assets aren't well suited for everyone, including beginning investors.The draw of Bank of America's stock is easy to understand. Most people in the United States have heard of the North Carolina-based bank. This goes along with author and investor Peter Lynch's advice to invest in what you know.Because Bank of America's shares are so heavily traded, moreover, investors needn't worry about buying into it and not being able to later sell their stock if and whenever they want to do so. The same can't be said for smaller, riskier stocks, which don't offer the same degree of liquidity.Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author.Despite the public's anger toward banks, fueled by recent revelations of a massive fraudat Wells Fargo, these companies provide a critical function in the economy -- allocating capital between savers and spenders -- and aren't about to go away anytime soon. This is particularly true with the too-big-to-fail banks -- thus the name.Despite all of this, beginning investors should nevertheless think twice before taking the plunge and buying Bank of America's stock.In the first case, Bank of America is an incredibly complicated company. I've studied and written about it more than all but a small handful of people over the past five years, and there are still many more things that I don't know about it than the things I do know. I'd go so far as to say that the vast majority of its own employees are in the same boat.What makes it so complicated is the fact that it provides all of the services of a traditional bank, an investment bank, and a wealth manager. These activities are subject to different, and often conflicting, cycles that cause the returns in each of the divisions to march to the beat of their own drums. For instance, while higher interest rates will be great for Bank of America's lending activities, it will hurt the value of its investment securities and could reduce revenue from its Wall Street operations.Additionally, Bank of America's shares are especially volatile. It has a beta of 1.7, meaning its shares are 70% more volatile on any given day than the broader market. By comparison, the average beta among large-cap bank stocks (i.e., members of the KBW Bank Index) is 1.21 -- that's 21% more volatile than the broader market, but nearly 50 percentage points less volatile than Bank of America.This is important because stocks that fluctuate wildly can cause investors to buy high and sell low. You buy when its shares are soaring, making you greedy. And you sell after its shares take a hit, making you fearful. Studies have shown that this is the typical investor's standard operating procedure.I'm bullish on Bank of America. It's one of my and my wife's largest stock holdings. My thesis is that its valuation and profitability, both of which were impaired during the financial crisis, will eventually recover.It's a long-term hold, in other words, and one that doesn't promise to be smooth sailing. If you can stomach the volatility, then it's worth a look. But if you can't, or you don't know how you'd react if its shares lost half their value, which could very well happen, then you should look elsewhere.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

The optimism has been fueled by hope that Trump will be able to deliver on his campaign vows to deregulate the financial services industry, cut the corporate tax rate, and accelerate economic growth with a $1 trillion Keynesian fiscal stimulus package.All of these policies would bolster profits at Bank of America, but it's looking increasingly probable that the Trump administration will come up short on these promises, not unlike how former presidents promised more than they could deliver on the campaign trail. If this happens, it seems reasonable to assume that Bank of America's stock could suffer the consequences, giving up much of its post-election surge.BACdata by YCharts.For long-term investors this would present a compelling opportunity to load up on Bank of America's stock. I say this for three reasons.In the first case, even though Bank of America's shares have soared over the past four months, they're far from overvalued. They currently trade for a 5% premium to book value. This is a significant improvementover a year ago, when they traded for a 40% discount to book value, but Bank of America's shares are still meaningfully cheaper than the average large-cap bank stock, which trades for a 52% premium to book value.On top of this, while the North Carolina-based bank has struggled over the past few years to generate the type of earnings that investors expect from a bank its size, it's made considerable progress on this front. Its return on tangible common equity last year was 9.54%. That's below its 12% goal, but much better than the 2.52% return on tangible common equity that Bank of America earned two years ago.Politics are the biggest risk to stocks right now. Image source: Getty Images.Finally, regardless of whether Trump can deliver on his campaign vows or not, it seems clear at this point that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates one or more times this year. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen saidas much in a recent speech.""[W]e currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect,"" Yellen said last week in Chicago. ""Indeed, at our meeting later this month, the Committee will evaluate whether employment and inflation are continuing to evolve in line with our expectations, in which case a further adjustment of the federal funds rate would likely be appropriate.""Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer echoed this sentiment in a separate address the same day. ""If there has been a conscious effort"" to boost expectations of a rate increase, ""I'm about to join it,"" he said. ""I think the advice that has been given by a large number of members of the Fed, of the FOMC [Federal Open Market Committee], is correct, and I strongly support it,"" Fischer continued.This bodes well for Bank of America, which will earn more moneyas rates climb. The increase in interest rates at the tail end of last year should already be translating into $600 millionworth of additional net interest income each quarter for the bank. And if rates were to rise three times this year, as projected by the Fed, then it could see its top line expand even more.Thus, even if stocks do fall, Bank of America is positioned to see its fundamental performance continue to improve, which is an auspicious sign for current and prospective investors in the bank.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.Over the last few weeks, there's been an increased amount of
attention paid to the question of whether or not the nation's
biggest banks can survive in their present form -- that is,
operating as both investment and commercial banks. While none of
the big banks are immune to this analysis,
Bank of America

(NYSE: BAC) is its posterchild.Bank of America's problem is that it isn't earning enough
money each year to satisfy investors. At a recent conference, CEO
Brian Moynihan
refuted this

, pointing to the fact that the nation's second biggest bank by
assets earned $16 billion last year. On a list of the world's
most profitable companies, that ranked Bank of America 15th in
terms of the size of its bottom line.But it isn't the size of the bank's net income that matters.
What matters instead is how much it earns relative to the
resources at its disposal. Bank of America has a $2.2
trillion balance sheet. On top of that, it oversees $2.7 trillion
worth of assets under management and custody, from which it also
generates revenue and earnings.The only fair way to assess Bank of America's profitability,
then, is to compare its earnings to figures like these. And by
doing this, one begins to appreciate why the North Carolina-based
bank trades for a roughly 40% discount to its book value.Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source:
Bank of America.Bank of America's $16 billion in earnings last year equated to
only 0.74% of its assets. That's roughly half as much as
Wells Fargo

 earns from its balance sheet on a comparable basis.Even more importantly, once you take Bank of America's
leverage into consideration -- after all, banks are fundamentally
nothing more than heavily leveraged funds that borrow copious
amounts of money at low short-term interest rates and then invest
the money into higher interest-earning assets -- its return on
average common shareholders' equity last year was a mere 6.26%.
Even if you use a more restricted measure of capital -- namely,
average tangible common shareholders' equity -- Bank of America's
return on equity is still only 9.11%.These are the numbers that matter -- not, as Moynihan knows,
the absolute size of its bottom line. They matter because a
bank's return on equity reveals whether it's creating value for
shareholders as opposed to destroying it.The issue of value creation turns on Bank of America's cost of
capital, which is currently in the neighborhood of 12.2%,
according to an analysis by Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital
Markets. If the Moynihan-led bank's return on equity exceeds
this, then it's said to be creating value. If it comes up short,
the opposite is true.Given this, it should be obvious why analysts and investors
have started questioning Bank of America's business model, which,
as a universal bank with both investment and commercial banking
operations, subjects it to a higher regulatory burden that in
turn weighs on its profitability.To Moynihan's point, Bank of America earns a lot of money, but
to analysts and investors' points, it doesn't earn as much as it
should. And until this gets sorted out, either by a divestiture
or through improved profitability, the bank's shares will
continue to trade for a lower multiple relative to those of its
peers.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

hasn't emerged completely from its past troubles, but its
latest
quarterly performance

shows that it's on the verge of doing so.The nation's second-biggest bank by assets blew away
expectations for the three months ended June 30,
reporting (opens PDF)

higher revenue, lower expenses, and its best earnings since the
onset of the financial crisis in 2008.As you can see in the five charts below, it was a breakout
quarter virtually across the board for Bank of America.1. Best pre-tax earnings since financial crisis



Anyone who has followed
Bank of America's saga

over the past few years knows it has struggled to report a
profit. Since the beginning of 2009, it has either lost money
or barely eked out pre-tax earnings in 10 out of 26
quarters.It's still too early to say with certainty, but the most
recent quarter could mark an end to this trend. From the
beginning of April through the conclusion of June, Bank of
America earned $7.5 billion before taxes, notching its best
performance since the financial crisis.2. Return on assets just under critical threshold



The objective of most banks is to earn at least 1% on their
assets -- meaning their annualized earnings equate to 1% or
more of their total assets. This is because a 1% return on
assets typically corresponds to a 10% return on equity, and the
latter is generally
assumed to dictate

whether a bank's shares trade for a premium or a discount to
book value.Bank of America hasn't come close to this threshold in the
past seven years, but in the latest quarter its 0.99% return on
assets finally brought the North Carolina-based bank to the
precipice. The question now is whether it can build on the
momentum and breach the threshold in the third or fourth
quarter.3. Expenses are finally normalizing



Bank of America has gone to great lengths over the past few
years to reduce expenses. Through its Project New BAC
initiative, the bank has trimmed $2 billion of quarterly
operating costs. Its legal team has put tens of billions of
dollars' worth of
lawsuits and regulatory actions

in the rearview mirror. And by disposing of noncore and legacy
assets, it has emerged with a more streamlined business
model.It wasn't until the latest results, however, that
shareholders could finally see the full fruits of these labors.
The metric that captures this best is the
efficiency ratio

, which measures how much a bank must spend to generate each
dollar of revenue -- lower is better. Great banks have ratios
between 50% and 60%. But until now, Bank of America's was
stubbornly in excess of 70% and not infrequently above 80%.Thus, if there's
one thing

that shareholders in the $2.2 trillion bank should rejoice,
it's the bank's 62.5% second-quarter efficiency ratio. This not
only represents a dramatic improvement over the past, but it
also positions Bank of America to compete more aggressively
against peers like
Wells Fargo

and
JPMorgan Chase

One of the main reasons Bank of America's expenses were so much
lower this year than in the second quarter of 2014 was that its
legal expenses dropped from $4 billion down to $200 million.
This was the least amount of money spent by the bank on legal
costs in the past four years; over that time period, its
average quarterly legal write-off amounted to $2.1 billion.5. B of A's ""bad bank"" is receding into the background



Since at least
the 1980s

, the standard operating procedure for a bank that finds itself
with an abundance of toxic assets on its balance sheet is to
segregate the assets into a newly created division, or ""bad
bank."" From there, they can be disposed of efficiently without
disturbing the bank's more promising operations.While
Citigroup

was the first to do so following the 2008 crisis with its Citi
Holdings subsidiary, Bank of America soon followed suit with
its legacy assets and servicing unit. At its height, B of A's
""bad bank"" employed 41,800 people. As of the latest quarter,
that figure is now down to 12,600. In short, if you want a
proxy for Bank of America's progress in atoning for past
managerial missteps, I believe this is the best one.Bank of America: Going forward



The market's reaction to Bank of America's second-quarter
earnings speaks for itself. At roughly halfway through the
trading session, shares of the megabank are trading nearly 4%
higher and are currently just under their 52-week high.Can Bank of America parlay this into better profits going
forward? That's the million-dollar question. After studying the
bank's turnaround in the 1980s, I recently
came to the conclusion

that it could. But only time will tell if this latest quarter
was indeed the turning point.This $19 trillion industry could destroy the
Internet

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.One of the main bank regulators in Washington, D.C. thinks Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) owes it some money, and it's filing a lawsuit to get it.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation filed a complaint in federal court on Monday against Bank of America, alleging that the bank improperly accounted for counterparty risk. By doing so, the FDIC claims that Bank of America was able to reduce the premiums it pays for deposit insurance.This isn't a nominal issue. The total amount owed by Bank of America, according to the FDIC, is $1 billion. However, the regulatory body is asking for only $542 million in its lawsuit.According to Bank of America, ""The amount in question, derived from a technical disagreement about a calculation from several years ago regarding a rule that has had changing provisions over time, comprises a fraction of what we annually pay to the FDIC.""For many Bank of America investors, this is like deja vu all over again. It took seven years in the wake of the financial crisisfor the North Carolina-based bank to put dozens of multibillion-dollar lawsuits to rest.All told, Bank of America has spent $64 billion on legal-related expenses since the crisis, equating to roughly a third of the $191 billionin total crisis-related costs incurred by the bank.Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author.Things took a turn for the betterin 2015, the year Bank of America finished retreating and retrenching from the financial crisis. The last of the large legal settlements and cases had been resolved. It had cut its core expense base by upwards of $15 billion a year. And its profitability improved markedly, as did the consistency of its earnings.Fast-forward to today, and Bank of America is primed to see its earnings grow from both higher interest ratesand, if the incoming presidential administration follows through on campaign promises, deregulation.With this as a backdrop, how should investors view the latest news of the FDIC's suit? Is this a harbinger of things to come or a one-off, immaterial development?It's my opinion that the FDIC's lawsuit doesn't change the investment thesis on Bank of America's stock. It's not good, as Bank of America could use every last dollar possible to hit the bottom line. But it's also far from existential.The damages sought in the case equate to around 11% or so of Bank of America's quarterly earnings. Moreover, according to Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, it would reduce Bank of America's tangible book value for the current year by only $0.04, or 0.2%.It'd be naive to say that investors shouldn't care about these things, as they do affect short-term profitability. However, the impact is likely to be so insignificant over the long term that it should be viewed as a minor and temporary setback for Bank of America.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.Mike Mayo, a longtime bank industry analyst, thinks big bank stocks still have a lot of room to run despite surging 30% in the wake of the presidential election.""We see 50% upside for bank stocks over the next three years, we are bulled-up on banks,"" Mayo saidWednesday afternoon on CNBC.That's a bold claim, considering that banks were among the best performing stocks in 2016. And that was despite the fact that profitability in the industry continues to suffer as a result of low interest rates and an oppressive regulatory environment.But while Mayo made this claim about bank stocks in general, is it safe to assume that it covers Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) in particular? I think there's a strong argument that it does.It's important to note that Mayo didn't say that bank stocks will surge by 50% tomorrow or next week or even next year. He's giving them three years to do so. With this in mind, it certainly seems reasonable to me that Bank of America's stock could increase by at least that much.Bank of America's stock currently trades for 1.35 times its tangible book value -- though this multiple should decrease when the bank reports its fourth-quarter earnings later this week, as its tangible book value is bound to have grown over the three-month period.That's not cheap, as it's comfortably above book value, but it's far less than the two to three times tangible book value that bank stocks tend to trade at when the business cycle nears its peak. It's only a matter of time, in other words, before Bank of America's stock could increase by even more than 50%.The question is thus less about ifthis will happen rather than whenit will happen. And on this note, I think there's reason to believe that it very well could happen within Mayo's three-year timeframe.BACdata by YCharts.Rising interest rates are the principal reason for this. In Bank of America's latest quarterly regulatory filing, it estimates that a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term interest rates should translate into $5.3 billion in added net interest income -- i.e., revenue. Since then, short-term rates have climbed by 25 basis points while long-term rates have increased by nearly 100 basis points.This alone will make Bank of America much more profitable than it's been over much of the last decade. It will also, to a point Mayo made on CNBC, allow it to earn its cost of capital, and thereby create value for shareholders.On top of this, the Federal Reserve has already signaled that it wants to continue boosting the fed funds rate, the primary short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States. According to its latest dot plot, a majority of the committee that sets monetary policy thinks that there could be three 25-basis-point interest rate hikes this year alone.And when you factor in the incoming presidential administration's promise to scale back regulations in the bank industry -- which would presumably allow banks to make more money, spend less on compliance, and return more capital to shareholders -- that should further fuel the rally in bank stocks as well.The point being, while Mayo's prediction seems bold, it also seems like there may be truth to it.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Bank of America
announced

a broad series of changes to its management team, starting with
its chief financial officer, Bruce Thompson.The 50-year-old executive is rumored to be leaving the
company, according to an internal memo distributed to bank
employees. Thompson had served in the role since 2011 and was
at one time the highest-paid CFO in the U.S. bank industry.It's impossible to say precisely why Thompson is leaving and
what that means for the nation's second biggest bank by assets.
Executive departures are not generally when public companies
shine in terms of transparency.Last week, Bank of America announced its
best quarterly performance

since the financial crisis. Its expenses dropped to a
reasonable level, the outlook for litigation costs
improved substantially

, and it generated a 0.99% return on assets, which is just
under the 1% threshold most banks strive to achieve.On top of that, CEO Brian Moyihan lauded Thompson's
contribution in a memo to employees. ""I am confident in saying
that no finance executive in the world in the past decade has
contended with greater challenges and discharged his
responsibilities with as much skill and grit as Bruce
Thompson,"" wrote the bank's chief.These comments aside,
The Wall Street Journal
insinuated

that the reasoning stemmed from Bank of America's struggles to
pass the Federal Reserve's
annual stress tests

, which fell most recently under Thompson's purview. The $2.2
trillion bank has either failed or won only conditional
approval to increase its dividend in three out of the past five
tests.The matter came to a head at Bank of America's 2015
shareholders' meeting, when Moynihan asked Thompson to address
questions about its problems passing the 2015 stress test while
other banks have seemed to sail right through it.Replacing Thompson at CFO is Paul Donofrio, who has been
with the bank since 1999. His most recent post was that of
strategic finance executive, serving as CFO of consumer banking
and global wealth and investment management.In addition to Thompson, Bank of America's one-time head of
consumer banking, David Darnell, will retire by the fourth
quarter. Darnell was part of the executive class dating back to
NationsBank, the North Carolina-based company that
assumed the mantel

following the 1998 merger with California's Bank of
America.Before Darnell's demotion in 2014 from co-chief operating
officer to vice chairman, he was considered a potential
successor to 55-year-old Moynihan. But even though Moynihan
praised Darnell in Wednesday's press release, calling him both
a friend and mentor, the move followed a pattern in which
Moynihan is systematically ridding the executive suite of
NationsBank partisans.Finally, four other changes were announced as well:Andrea Smith was promoted to chief administrative
officer.Anne Finucane was appointed vice chairman and continues
as the company's global chief strategy and marketing
officer.Cathy Bessant remains head of the company's technology
and operations areas, though the position was redesignated
chief operations and technology officer.Gary Lynch, the bank's global general counsel, was
appointed vice chairman.After climbing more than 2% in today's session, shares of
Bank of America are marginally lower in after-hours
trading.This $19 trillion industry could destroy the

Shares of the nation's second biggest bank by assets are off 0.62% since the start of 2016. What's behind the fall? There are three culprits.BACdata by YCharts.Bank of America's stock fell sharply at the beginning of the year, bottoming out around $11 per share in February. The problem at the time was that low energy prices were fueling higher default ratesin its energy portfolio.As the bank noted in its first-quarter earnings release, its provision for credit losses in its global banking unit leapt by $457 million in the quarter, ""driven primarily by increases in energy-related reserves.""Oil prices at the time at time had dropped to the lowest point in more than a decade, dipping below $30 a barrel. This made it difficult for Bank of America's customers in the energy industry to service their loans.Brent Crude Oil Spot Pricedata by YCharts.The good news is thatoil priceshave since rebounded and are now around $50 a barrel, relieving the pressure on banks to aggressively provision for future loan losses from the sector.At roughly the same time that energy prices were dipping below $30 a barrel, it was announced that the United Kingdom would hold a referendum in June over whether to remain in the European Union.The news sent financial markets into a tailspin. No one knew then, or now, what an eventual separation would mean in terms of global markets. In addition, for banks with a substantial presence in London, like Bank of America, there's reason to believe that they'll have to relocate a portion of their European operations to the continent.One side-effect of the uncertainty was that Bank of America's institutional investor clients stepped back from the markets. This drove down the bank's trading revenuefor the first quarter by 16% on a year-over-year basis.As time passed, and confidence built that the U.K. wouldn't exit the EU, Bank of America's stock mounted a new ascent. But this climb was brought to a screeching halt in June, when voters in the U.K. voted in favor of leaving the union. The result sent Bank of America's stock tumbling again.Finally, while the two preceding issues served as isolated shocks, the persistently low interest-rate environmenthas weighed on bank profits throughout the year.At the end of 2015, the Federal Reserve boosted the benchmark Fed Funds rate by 0.25%, leading analysts and commentators to expect more rate hikes in the near future. But the uncertainty caused by low energy prices and the U.K.'s decision to leave the EU, persuaded the Fed to stand pat.Effective Federal Funds Ratedata by YCharts.This is bad news for banks, and Bank of America in particular. To put it in perspective, if the central bank were to raise rates by only 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank would earn $7.5 billion more in net interest income a year. That's a lot of money when you consider that it currently earns less than $5 billion a quarter.In sum, it's been a tough year for bank stocks. But the good news is that, given Bank of America's bargain-basement valuation, trading as it does for 30% below book value, there's every reason to believe that its shares have a lot of room to grow from here.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

expect given its economic issues, investors in
Bank of America

can take solace in the fact that the Charlotte, North
Carolina-based bank has dramatically reduced its exposure to
the Asian country over the past few years.Concerns about China came into focus on Tuesday after its
central bank reversed its years-long exchange-rate policy by
devaluing the Yuan. The move is particularly troubling to
non-Chinese banks that have made dollar-denominated loans to
Chinese corporations. This is because the cost of servicing
those loans increases in proportion to the extent of
devaluation.Let's assume, for example, that XYZ Corporation, a Chinese
company, borrows $100 million from Bank of America at an annual
interest rate of 7%. Before Tuesday's devaluation, XYZ Corp.'s
annual interest expense would cost it 42.8 million Yuan. After
Tuesday's devaluation, the cost increases to 43.6 million
Yuan.This alone probably won't trigger widespread defaults, as
the increase amounts to only 1.8%. But it could hurt on the
margin, and particularly at highly leveraged companies that are
already having problems making ends meet.The good news for Bank of America's shareholders is that,
while the bank has lent money to borrowers in China, it long
ago shed its most significant exposure to the country: its
substantial ownership stake in China Construction Bank. At its
peak in late 2008, Bank of America owned nearly 20% of China
Construction Bank. Over the next three years, however, it
whittled this down to less than 1%, raising nearly $23 billion
in desperately needed capital along the way.The nation's second biggest bank by assets is left with
roughly $12 billion in total exposure to China. This is split
between funded loans ($9.8 billion), unfunded loan commitments
($385 million), net counterparty exposure ($691 million), and
securities or other types of investments ($1.3 billion).Ideally, Bank of America wouldn't lose any money on any of
these assets. But if it does lose a small fraction, which seems
reasonable if things continue in the direction they're going, I
would guess that the impact isn't likely to materially impair
the $2.2 trillion bank's earnings.This $19 trillion industry could destroy the

accumulated more than enough gold in the pot at the end of its
rainbow. Image credit: iStock/Thinkstock.One of the many challenges that
Bank of America

faces in the aftermath of the financial crisis is that it must
operate with less leverage

. This requires it to hold more capital relative to its assets
than it did in the years before the crisis.While there are four ways that regulators measure capital,
the most important is the Tier 1 common capital ratio. This
looks at the creme de la creme of bank capital, Tier 1 common
capital, which includes common equity (i.e., not preferred
stock), retained earnings, and other comprehensive income --
the latter reflects increases and decreases in the value of a
bank's securities portfolio, among other things.The Four Capital RatiosWell-Capitalized Threshold Applicable to Bank of

Source: Bank of America's
3Q15 10-Q

(page 62) and its
4Q15 financial supplement

(pages 8-9).Bank of America had $163 billion worth of Tier 1 common
capital at the end of last year. This consisted of $151 billion
worth of common equity and $88.6 billion worth of retained
earnings, offset by $70 billion in goodwill (an intangible
asset) and a $5.7 billion deficit in accumulated other
comprehensive income.To calculate the Tier 1 common capital ratio, this figure is
then divided by a bank's risk-weighted assets, which amounted
to $1.4 trillion at the end of last year. This yields a ratio
of 11.6% for Bank of America.This is more than enough capital to be considered a
""well-capitalized bank,"" which frees Bank of America from
""certain mandatory actions"" regulators are required to take if
a bank comes up short of this characterization. Banks that
don't meet this threshold, for instance, are subject to
restrictions on capital distributions (presumably above and
beyond those incident to the stress tests each year) and
discretionary bonus payments.Bank of America's Tier 1 common capital ratio must be at
least 10% in order to be considered well-capitalized for
regulatory purposes. This figure is made up of a baseline of
4.5 percentage points that all banks must satisfy regardless of
their size or systematic importance, 2.5 percentage points for
a capital conservation buffer, and 3.0 additional points
because Bank of America is classified as a
global systematically important bank

.To put all of this into context, as of Bank of America's
third quarter 10-Q

, an increase in its Tier 1 common capital ratio by one basis
point (that is, 0.01%) would require it to retain $139 million
of its earnings. Alternatively, it could achieve the same
result by reducing its risk-weighted assets by $1.2
billion.At this point, building additional capital seems
unnecessary, as Bank of America already has more than enough to
be considered well capitalized. As of the end of 2015, its $163
billion in Tier 1 common capital exceeded the 10% threshold by
$23 billion. This will be
particularly beneficial in June

, when Bank of America and the nation's other biggest banks
request permission from the Federal Reserve to return more
capital to shareholders.The next billion-dollar iSecret

CEO Brian Moynihan's Compensation","{'$date': '2016-03-02T16:07:03Z'}","By John Maxfield, The Motley Fool, Motley Fool","https://www.nasdaq.com/author/fool","Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of
America.Bank of America

announced last month that its CEO, Brian Moynihan, received a
$3 million pay raise in 2015. It also
disclosed

details of how that pay was structured. Here are three charts
that cast light on this:1. Comparison to other bank CEOs



Moynihan earned a total of $16 million last year, split between
cash- and stock-based compensation. That ranked him last among
the major Wall Street banks in terms of total pay. The list was
topped by
JPMorgan Chase

's Jamie Dimon, who,
in my opinion

, deserves to be the highest-paid bank CEO in the country.Data source: JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, and
The Wall Street Journal

.The one wild card is
Wells Fargo

, which tends to release details of its executive compensation
when it files its proxy statement in March. That said, it's
reasonable to assume that Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf will get
a bigger compensation package than Moynihan. And he should,
given Wells Fargo's
consistently superior performance

.2. Immediate vs. deferred compensation



The thing that Bank of America shareholders should be happiest
about in terms of Moynihan's compensation package is the fact
that most of it is in the form of deferred compensation.
Leaving skin in the game incentivizes Moynihan to take a
longer-term approach to running the bank, which is important in
an industry where short-term revenue gains often come at the
expense of long-term solvency.The majority of Moynihan's compensation, or 51%, is in the
form of performance-based restricted stock units that vest
three years from now. To earn this, Bank of America must
generate a three-year average return on assets of 0.80% and a
three-year average growth of adjusted tangible book value of
8.5%. The former metric in particular is nothing to write home
about, but it would nevertheless mark an improvement over last
year.*Assumes assume a similar allocation schedule to 2014, which
Bank of America reported to be the case. Data source: Bank of
America.The rest of Moynihan's compensation vests either immediately
or at some point over the next two years. His $1.5 million base
salary was paid out presumably on or about Feb. 12, 2016, when
the bank published its compensation figures. Then, assuming an
identical allocation to 2014, which Bank of America intimated
was the case, Moynihan will earn $5.3 million over the next 12
months. Finally, two years from now, he'll get approximately $1
million in the second of three installments of time-based
restricted stock units.3. Cash- vs. stock-based compensation



The final distinction that's relevant to shareholders is the
division between cash- and stock-based compensation. Like
deferred compensation, the latter keeps more of a CEO's skin in
the game, so to speak, and is thus good from the perspective of
shareholders.In Moynihan's case, the vast majority of his compensation is
either cash, or consists of restricted stock units that pay out
in cash upon vesting. Assuming again that the allocation and
particulars of Moynihan's compensation mirror 2014, which we'll
learn in Bank of America's 2016 proxy statement, then 82% of
his compensation will be paid out in cash, with only 18% paid
out in stock.Data source: Bank of America.This obviously minimizes Moynihan's equity-based stake in
the bank. On top of this, he's required to retain only 50% of
the stock that he's awarded. He'll hopefully do the right thing
and leave the entirety of it in the bank. But if he doesn't,
shareholders should consider that a red flag and a reason to
sell its stock.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

second


notable thing about the Q3 earnings season is the widespread
revenue weakness. Not only is revenue growth non-existent (down
-1.7% at this stage), but few companies are able to come out with
positive revenue surprises despite the very low levels to which
estimates had come down as result of the well-known global growth
and unfavorable currency issues. This was a big issue the last
earnings season as well, but analysts seem to have failed to make
adequate adjustments to their models and estimates for Q3 either,
resulting in widespread top-line misses across all sectors.



As you can see in the chart below, earnings revenue beat ratios are
tracking below what we saw from the same group of 105 S&P 500
members in other recent quarters. But the shortfall in revenue
surprises is particularly notable.Third


, estimates for the current period have sharply started coming down
in recent days, with total earnings for the S&P 500 index
currently expected to be down -5.6% from the same period last year.
This will be the third back-to-back quarter of declining earnings
for the S&P 500 index.The chart below shows current Zacks consensus earnings growth
expectations for the coming 4 quarters as well as the same for 2015
Q3 (shaded orange) and the actual growth achieved in the first two
quarters of the year. As you can see, this year's growth has
effectively evaporated, with growth momentum expected to pick up in
2016 Q2 and accelerate in the following quarters.Total earnings for the S&P 500 index are effectively flat
this year, but are expected to be up strong next year. It is
reasonable to be skeptical of next year's optimistic looking
expectations given how the 2015 estimates evaporated in front of
our eyes over the last two quarters. Maybe it will be different
this time, but judging from what we have heard from management
teams on the Q3 earnings calls in recent days, it is more than
reasonable to be skeptical of these growth expectations for the
outer periods.Note

part of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Others issued warrants
to entice investors to make riskier, but potentially more
profitable, bets on a bank's stock.Bank of America

's warrants have been especially popular among investors. In
this article, I'll explain the complicated nature of its stock
warrants, and how much investors can make by buying Bank of
America's warrants instead of the common stock. (If you need to
freshen up on the mechanics of stock warrants, first read this
article on
how warrants work

.)How Bank of America's A warrants work



Bank of America's A warrants give investors the right to buy one
share of Bank of America at $13.30 per share on January 16, 2019.
The ticker for this warrant varies by broker, but a common ticker
has been
Bank of America

.One interesting twist with the A warrants is the anti-dilution
provision. The anti-dilution provision reduces the exercise price
and increases the number of shares each warrant represents, to
account for a dividend that is greater than the dividend at the
time the warrants were issued.Currently, Bank of America's stock pays a $0.05 quarterly
dividend, which is greater than the $0.01 dividend paid at the
time the warrants hit the market, triggering the anti-dilution
provision.Because of this provision, the exercise price of each warrant
is currently in decline. According to a recent
disclosure

, Bank of America's A warrants now have a exercise price of
$13.267 per share.DateExercise PriceShares per WarrantInitial sale (January 2009)$13.301.0September 2014 (current)$13.2671.0Source:

.In all reality, the published numbers above are rounded. The
terms of the warrants require Bank of America to round the
exercise price to one-tenth of a cent, and shares to one-tenth of
a share.To give you a picture of what these numbers look like without
this rounding, I created the following table, using the

owners to buy goes up with each dividend, but the true economic
impact only occurs at discrete intervals (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and so
on).Given the mathematical relationship between dividends and the
anti-dilution adjustment, the dividend will have to increase
substantially, or the share price decline dramatically, in order
for the warrants to be worth more than 1 share each at
expiration.Unfortunately, modelling the returns for these warrants is all
but impossible to do perfectly. One would have to know Bank of
America's stock price when it pays every future dividend, as well
as the future dividend it pays. However, we can model returns
based on the current rounded exercise price, and rounded shares
per warrant, to generate a conservative return assumption at
various stock prices in the future.How much can you make?



The table below shows the expected profit based on varying prices
for Bank of America's stock on January 16, 2019.Future Stock PriceA Warrant ReturnStock Return$5.00-100%-63%$10.00-100%-37%$15.00-76%-5%$20.00-8%26%$25.0061%58%$30.00129%89%The table above assumes a starting share price of $16, and a
common stock dividend of $0.05 until January 2019. The warrant
exercise price and shares per warrant are assumed to stay
constant from their rounded September 2014 values.Bank of America's B Warrants



Bank of America's B warrants are far more speculative than the A
warrants. The B warrants, available under the ticker
Bank of America

 (NYSE: BAC.WSB), allow investors to buy Bank of America
shares at a price of $30.79 on or before October 28, 2018.Additionally, the warrants have an anti-dilutive provision to
adjust the exercise price and shares per warrant, but only if the
quarterly dividend exceeds $0.32 per share.DateExercise PriceShares per WarrantInitial sale in 2008 (current)$30.791.00The anti-dilutive provision has not been triggered, and it is
unlikely it will any time soon, given the current dividend of
just $0.05 per quarter. The table below shows the potential
profits for the B warrants.Future Stock PriceWarrant ReturnStock Return$15.00-100%-1%$20.00-100%25%$25.00-100%58%$30.00-100%89%$35.00426%120%$40.001,051%151%The table above assumes a starting share price of $16, and a
common stock dividend of $0.05 until October 2018. The warrant
exercise price and shares per warrant are assumed to stay
constant at their current, September 2014 values.As you can see, B warrants require a much greater return on
Bank of America common stock than the A warrants in order to be
profitable. Shares will need to roughly double from their share
price in September 2014 to justify their exercise.Naturally, the B warrants will likely create a much bigger
profit or loss than the A warrants, due to the exceptionally high
exercise price.The bottom line



Bank of America's stock warrants can be an intriguing way to play
the recovery of one of America's largest banks. The A warrants
may be the most compelling, given that they have the
longest-dated expiration, the lowest exercise price, and a
currently active anti-dilution provision that is reducing the
exercise price while increasing the number of shares each warrant
represents.In the future, this article will be updated to record the
effects of the anti-dilution provision, as well as the changing
profit potential for each warrant. Bookmark this page for future

Shares of the nation's second largest bank by assets climbed 28% last month, reaching their highest point since the financial crisis.You can get a sense for Bank of America's performance by comparing it with the KBW Bank Index, which tracks two dozen of the country's biggest banks. The index rose 17.4% in November. That's impressive, but it obviously comes up short of Bank of America.Similarly, while the broader market rallied last month, it too was left in the dust by the North Carolina-based bank. The S&P 500 index finished November 3.4% higher than where it started.Stock/IndexNovember GainsBank of America28.0%KBW Bank Index17.4%S&P 5003.4%Data sources: Yahoo! Finance, YCharts.com.By this point, you probably have a pretty good idea about why bank stocks, and shares of Bank of America in particular, performed so well in November. As you can see in the chart below, Bank of America's stock rose abruptly roughly a week into the month. The timing corresponded to the presidential election.BACdata by YCharts.Throughout the campaign, President-elect Donald Trump promised to overhaul the increasingly stringent regulatory regime that has weighed heavily on bank earnings since the financial crisis. By contrast, opponent Hillary Clinton's team offered the prospect of even tighter rules on banks, evidenced by the leading role that Sen. Elizabeth Warren played in Clinton's campaign.Warren has long been a critic of the bank industry, calling for criminal investigations of leading banks and serving as the brains behind the formation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has targeted banks for a variety of consumer abuses over the past five years.When Trump prevailed, not only did banks dodge a bullet, but they are also likely to benefit from a loosening of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Consumer Protection Act, the legislation underlying the heightened regulatory regime. Throughout the campaign, Trump promised to ""dismantle"" Dodd-Frank. And that promise was backed up by his choice for Treasury secretary -- former Goldman Sachsbanker Steven Mnuchin.""The number one problem with Dodd-Frank is that it's way too complicated and cuts back lending,"" Mnuchin told CNBC this week. ""So we want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank and that will be the number one priority on the regulatory side.""There are a variety of ways in which Bank of America and other banks could benefit from reduced regulation. Easing capital and liquidity rules would free up hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of assets on bank balance sheets that could then be lent out to businesses and consumers. Rolling back the Volcker rule, an element of Dodd-Frank that prevents banks from engaging in certain investment activities, would pave the way for banks to get back into proprietary trading. And putting a tighter leash on the CFPB could spur innovation in the industry by giving banks a freer hand to introduce new products without fear of regulatory backlash as the products are tested and perfected.On top of this, if Trump also follows through on his promise to reduce taxes and invest heavily in infrastructure projects, any resulting lift to the economy could spur inflation. That would incentivize the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates, which would boost the money that banks earn from their loan portfolios.In sum, while Trump certainly has his detractors, there's no question that his victory in the presidential election is good news for bank stocks -- and few have seen more benefit than Bank of America.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

for safety and a little growth.If you're looking to park your short-term dollars somewhere,
give some thought to money market accounts. Their interest rates
are very low these days, but don't let that stop you from seeking
the best money market rates you can find. Even small differences
in rates can amount to a lot of money.Let's quickly review what a money market account actually is.
Available at banks and other financial institutions, it's a
savings vehicle with interest rates that are usually better than
those of bank savings accounts. The interest rates offered can
sometimes be tiered according to how much money you have in the
account. Money market accounts also often feature limited
check-writing privileges. There can be some drawbacks, such as a
limited number of withdrawals over set periods and required
minimum balances higher than those of some other accounts.Money market accounts are not designed to make you rich, but
rather to protect your money and let it grow a bit, too. Their
assets are invested in relatively low-risk assets, such as
certificates of deposit (CDs), government debt, and corporate
bonds. Money market accounts can be protected by the FDIC, just
like most bank accounts. Just be sure to check with the bank or
institution through which you're investing in one. (And be
careful not to confuse money market accounts with money market
funds

, which are not FDIC-insured and offer inferior rates these
days.)An example



I clicked over to
Bank of America

's website to check out their money market account offerings. I
was shown a few savings options, such as a savings account that
offered an interest rate of 0.01% and a money market account that
paid 0.03%. Each sported a minimum deposit of $25. The savings
account charged a $5 monthly fee, which would be waived if you
met one of certain requirements, such as a minimum daily balance
of $300. The money market account charged a $12 monthly fee,
which would be waived if you met one of certain requirements,
such as a minimum daily balance of $2,500.Those of greater means can earn even more than the 0.03%
interest rate for the basic money market account, because Bank of
America has tiered rates. ""Preferred Rewards Gold"" accounts
(for those with a three-month average combined balance in all
their qualifying Bank of America accounts of at least $20,000)
were paying 0.05%, while ""Preferred Rewards Platinum"" accounts
were paying 0.08% (minimum total balance: $50,000) and ""Preferred
Rewards Platinum Honors"" accounts paid 0.10% (minimum total
balance: $100,000).Money market funds are best used for short-term savings.

.The best money market rates



To find the best money market rates, head over to a site such as
Bankrate.com, which lists average rates and the best available
rates, nationally and in your state. In late December, its range
for money market accounts and savings accounts nationwide was
0.05%-1.05%, with a national average of 0.09%.The difference between 0.05% and 1.05% is a single percentage
point. Let's see just how much of a difference that can make.
Here's how a $10,000 investment would grow at both rates over
various periods of time:Time FrameValue of $10,000 Investment Growing at 0.05%5 years$10,025$10,53610 years$10,050$11,10120 years$10,100$12,32330 years$10,151$13,68040 years$10,202$15,186Clearly, that single percentage point makes a big difference:
Even over just a decade, you can earn more than a thousand
additional dollars at the higher interest rate.Of course, interest rates won't stay this low forever, and
many expect them to start rising soon. So check out that
1-percentage-point difference applied to higher rates:Time FrameValue of $10,000 Investment Growing at 4.05%5 years$11,621$12,19610 years$13,505$14,87420 years$18,237$22,12330 years$24,629$32,90540 years$33,260$48,942Over greater numbers of years, the difference grows much
wider, and that could make a big difference in, for example, an
emergency fund. You want to have emergency-fund money always
available and not losing value, so money market funds (or CDs)
could be a sensible option. Thus you would do well to seek the
best money market rates you can find in order to maximize your
savings.Still, remember that for any money you want to grow briskly
over a period of years or decades, you should focus elsewhere,
such as the stock market. Even relatively stable, slow-growing
stocks generally grow faster than money market funds, and these
days, even modest dividend yields alone will top money markets'
interest rates.How one Seattle couple secured a $60K Social Security

The latest reading on the employment front offers yet more proof that the time might soon be right for the Fed to do so.On Friday, the Labor Department releasedits employment data for the month of February. The economy added 235,000 jobs last month, which was down slightly from January, but was nevertheless a very good showing. The average over the past three months is only 209,000. And the monthly average over two years is 206,000. After accounting for the new jobs, the unemployment rate came out to 4.7% in February, remaining well below the central bank's 5% target.Data source: Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, U.S. Labor Department. Chart by author.From every indication we've gotten from the Fed, this strongly suggests that the central bank will indeed pull the trigger and raise rates at its meeting later this month.Last week, Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said that ""we currently judge that it will be appropriate to gradually increase the federal funds rate if the economic data continue to come in about as we expect."" This was seconded by Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer, who said that he ""strongly supports"" the opinion that rates should rise if economic data continues to be positive.This is music to banks' ears. To understand why higher rates are so important, it's helpful to analogize a bank to a bookstore. Holding all else equal, if the prices of books go up, so too will a bookstore's revenue. Given that banks sell money, the price of which is denominated by interest rates, the same will be true for lenders when interest rates rise.In Bank of America's case, it will already see a boost to its net interest income this year from the Fed's decision in December to increase the fed funds rate by 25 basis points, as well as by an earlier surge in long-term rates. These should add an extra $600 millionto the bank's top line each quarter. Consequently, any added benefit from a future rate hike will be on top of this.If the Fed raises rates, Bank of America will see its earnings rise. Image source: Getty Images.To determine how much Bank of America will benefit from future rate hikes, one can find an interest rate sensitivity analysis in the North Carolina-based bank's annual regulatory filing for 2016, on page 84 of its 10-K. This shows that an increase of 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, in short- and long-term rates should translate into $3.4 billion worth of additional net interest income a year. If you divide that by four, as the Fed seems poised to raise rates in increments of 25 basis points, you get $850 million in added annual net interest income, which equates to $212 million a quarter.That's not a game-changing amount, as Bank of America earns around $4 billion a quarter, but it will add up quickly if the Fed raises rates an additional two times this year, as its current projections suggest. In fact, taken together with Bank of America's continuing efforts to trim expenses, it could mean that the $2.2 trillion bank might meet its top profitability goalon an annualized basis by the end of this year, which would mark yet another chapter in its post-financial-crisis recovery.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

.This podcast was recorded on April 14, 2016.Chris Hill:

 First-quarter profits for Bank of America down
13% compared to a year ago, but that was
still slightly better than expected. You looked at the
quarter, JP. What stood out to you?


JP Bennett:

 The first thing that stood out to me is, if you go on
a Bloomberg terminal, you can look at a chart of
analyst estimates, and what you'll see is, analyst estimates
for this quarter over the past 12 months basically went from
top left to bottom right. So, they're down, like, 45% for --


Jeff Fischer:

 Over the past --


Hill:

 For Bank of America?


Bennett:

 For this quarter, yeah. Their earnings estimate over the
past 12 months fell by 45%. So yeah, they ""beat,"" but you need
to use some quotation marks.


Hill:

 Air quotes.


Bennett:

 Yeah. So basically, what you had here was kind of a tale
of two cities. The consumer banking side did pretty
good. Earnings for this part of the business up 22%, so $1.8
billion. They saw an increase in spending, an increase in
deposits. But then you look at the other part of their
business. Investment banking fees fell 22%, trading revenue
down 16%, and interestingly, they had to -- and perhaps not
really all that surprisingly -- increase their provisions for
credit losses for exposure to the energy markets by, like,
around $500 million. So there really is a tale of two cities
there. One side of the business doing pretty decent, the other
side not nearly as much.


Hill:

 Is that a refrain we're going to be hearing from all the
big banks, about energy? Because it certainly was the last time
around, when we did earnings.


Bennett:

 I would say big and small banks, if they have exposure. I
think there probably are some smaller banks that are probably a
lot more heavily concentrated. During the boom, they saw all
this money, they got a lot of exposure, worked out great
for a couple of years, and now I think you're going to see some
smaller banks be in a world of hurt.


Fischer:

 Yeah, I think the bigger banks, the one thing they are
doing right, whether it's Bank of America,[
JPMorgan Chase

], or
Wells Fargo

, is getting more customers in the door. And that's really
what their focus is right now. As Bank of America pointed out,
you have strong job gains in this country, you have increasing
home prices, you have higher stocks, they mentioned, and you
have the beginning of rising wages. So you do have strong
consumers, JP just talked about. But you have low interest
rates, so you're not going to make much money there, and low
commodity prices, of course. So, what they're focused on is
building customer relationships, getting the number of clients
up, and then when interest rates do go up, they'll earn even
higher profits as a result. But right now, you can make pretty
decent money on a giant client customer base. And if you keep
growing it, that's one way to slowly grow.


Bennett:

 Yeah. The net interest margin spread -- the difference
between what they get when they lend out money and what
they have to pay out when people give them money --
that's kind of not under their control. So it's good to
see them focusing on what they can control, which is
trying to gain additional clients. So if we ever do see rates
move up again, then they'll be poised to really benefit from
that in a meaningful way.The article

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.It's been three years in the making, but it's finally
happened:
Bank of America

(NYSE: BAC) emerged from both rounds of this year's stress test
unscathed, clearing the way for the nation's second biggest bank
by assets to boost its dividend by 50% and repurchase $5 billion
worth of stock over the next 12 months.After the market closed on Thursday, the Federal Reserve
released the results

from the stress test's second round, the comprehensive capital
analysis and review, or CCAR. While shares of Bank of America
were up nearly 4% during the trading day, they've headed even
higher in after-hours trading in response to the news.""Over the last few years, we have significantly strengthened
our company and increased our earnings as we execute a
straightforward strategy focused on responsible growth,""
said

chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. ""This improvement has allowed us
to take a significant step toward returning more capital to
shareholders.""The purpose of the first round of the stress test,
the results of which were announced last week

, is to determine whether the nation's biggest banks have enough
capital to survive a severe economic downturn. The second round
then examines banks' capital planning processes and approves or
denies requests to boost dividends and/or share repurchase
programs.Bank of America sailed through this year's first round with
far more capital than it needed to satisfy regulators. It entered
the Fed's hypothetical nine-quarter scenario, which resembled a
combination of the 2008 financial crisis and the 2011 European
sovereign debt crisis, with a common equity tier 1 capital ratio
of 11.6% and exited with a 8.1% ratio. The latter comfortably
exceeded its regulatory minimum 5.9% common equity tier 1 capital
ratio. (

to see three charts that reflect this performance.)But even though Bank of America passed muster on the first
round of the stress tests over the past two years -- the
quantitative

round -- it has struggled on the second round -- the
qualitative

round. In 2014, it belatedly discovered that it had mismarked the
value of debt securities inherited in its 2008 acquisition of
Merrill Lynch. This led the Fed to
require

the bank to resubmit its capital plan and suspend planned
increases in capital distributions until the issue was resolved,
which it was

.Last year, meanwhile, the Fed took issue with Bank of
America's capital planning process more generally. The North
Carolina-based bank was thus required to submit a new capital
plan to ""address certain weaknesses"" in its processes, though the
bank was nevertheless allowed to boost its share buyback
plan.The consequences of these struggles have been threefold.
First, Bank of America rearranged the executives in charge of its
annual stress test submission. Second, the issues have fueled
skepticism among investors, which helps explain why its shares
continue to trade for a nearly 20% discount to tangible book
value eight years after the financial crisis. And third, unlike
many of its peers, who have raised their dividends annually since
2011, Bank of America has boosted its quarterly payout only once
-- in 2014.One consequence of retaining so much capital is that Bank of
America's return on equity is roughly half its 12% cost of
capital. Over the last 12 months, for instance, it returned only
6.6% on its equity. That compares to an 8.7% average on the KBW
Bank Index, which tracks shares of the nation's 24 biggest
commercial banks. Meanwhile,
Wells Fargo

's return on equity over the same period is 13.3%, according to
data from YCharts.com. This also goes a long way toward
explaining why Bank of America's shares trade for such a large
discount to its tangible book value.Given its performance on this year's test, though, it's
reasonable to assume that this valuation gap will begin to close.
And if Bank of America is able to follow this up with a good
earnings performance next month, investors could see them head
even higher.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

Bank of America

's second-quarter earnings in the rearview mirror -- and an
excellent quarter

it was! -- the second and more substantive phase of the
publicly traded bank's earnings ritual kicked off last week
with the filing of its comprehensive quarterly update, its
10-Q

.If you've ever made your way through a big bank's 10-Q, then
you know what a laborious process it is. Bank of America's
latest submission clocks in at 239 pages, covering everything
from pending legal proceedings to risk factors to the
management's detailed analysis of the bank's performance over
the last three months. But while the most important updates are
generally found deep within the $2.2 trillion bank's filing,
they're front and center in the most recent one.The first update is that Bank of America's harrowing
seven-year
legal odyssey

may finally be coming to an end. As the bank explained, a
recent ruling by New York highest court allowed the nation's
second biggest bank by assets to lop of $7.6 billion in
outstanding legal claims related to toxic mortgages that date
back to the financial crisis.The Court of Appeals held that, under New York law, a
claim for breach of contractual representations and
warranties begins to run at the time the representations and
warranties are made, and rejected the argument that the
six-year statute of limitations does not begin to run until
the time repurchase is refused. The Court of Appeals also
held that compliance with the contractual notice and cure
period was a pre-condition to filing suit, and claims that
did not comply with such contractual requirements prior to
the expiration of the statute of limitations were invalid. .
. . The decision resulted in a reduction in our unresolved
repurchase claims, a benefit in the provision for
representations and warranties, and a decrease to both our
accrued liability and estimated range of possible loss for
representations and warranties exposures.To give you an appreciation for the magnitude of this
development, here's a chart I made of quarterly legal claims
(related to toxic mortgages) submitted to Bank of America over
the past five quarters. The substantial decline in the latest
period is the result of this case.The second update is that Bank of America is still working
feverishly to meet the Federal Reserve's expectations regarding
the quality and thoroughness of the bank's capital-planning
process.Following this year's
stress tests

, the bank had to resubmit its capital plans -- its request to
boost its dividend and repurchase more common stock -- after
uncovering a $4 billion error in the way it valued securities
inherited in its
2008 acquisition of Merrill Lynch

. As a result of the disclosure, the Fed demanded that Bank of
America resubmit its capital plan by the end of September.It was the third time the North Carolina-based bank has run
into problems with the stress test in the last five years, and
many believe it contributed to a recent
management shakeup

, the centerpiece of which was CFO Bruce Thompson's
departure.As the bank noted on page 5 of its 10-Q:Based on the conditional non-objection we received from
the Federal Reserve on our 2015 [stress test] submission, we
are required to resubmit our CCAR capital plan by September
30, 2015 and address certain weaknesses identified in the
capital planning process. We have responded to the
Federal Reserve with action plans to review and make
improvements to our CCAR process to better align with
regulatory expectations. We are currently in the process of
executing on this plan.The third update also relates to capital adequacy -- though,
this time Bank of America isn't being singled out. Last month,
the Fed finalized its rules regarding how much additional
capital the nation's biggest banks are required to hold under
more stringent, Dodd-Frank mandated rules and regulations.The most important component of this -- the systematically
important financial institution surcharge, or SIFI surcharge --
requires the largest lenders to hold markedly more capital than
their smaller counterparts. This matters because banks
make money by using leverage

. They start with, say, $10 million in capital, leverage that
up with $90 million in debt from depositors and institutional
investors, and then use the combined proceeds to purchase
interest-earning assets. In large part, in turn, a bank's
income comes from the extent to which it can magnify its
capital base.How much more capital are big banks required to hold? That
depends on the size of the bank and its role in the global
financial industry. The nation's largest bank by assets,
JPMorgan Chase

, must reserve an additional 4.5% of its capital as insulation
against future losses, whereas Bank of America must hold an
additional 3%.Finally, as I alluded to earlier, Bank of America included a
brief note about multiple changes to its management team which
were initially
announced

two weeks ago. The three most significant are:CFO Bruce Thompson is
leaving the companyFormer co-COO David Darnell is retiringTwo of Moynihan's colleagues dating back to their days at
FleetBoston Financial, which merged with Bank of America in
2003, were given elevated titles and responsibilityI, for one, don't think shareholders should read too much
into these moves. As opposed to hinting at possible problems,
they seem to me to be the result of the natural turnover that
one should expect at the top of any company.This $19 trillion industry could destroy the

However, what's important to understand is that higher rates aren't invariably good for banks.To learn why this is, listen in to the segment below of this week's episode ofIndustry Focus: Financials , in which The Motley Fool's Michael Douglass and contributor John Maxfield discuss how higher rates are good for bank income statements but bad for their balance sheets.A full transcript follows the video.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market.*David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the10 best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Bank of America wasn't one of them! That's right -- they think these 10 stocks are even better buys.Click here to learn about these picks!*Stock Advisor returns as of January 4, 2017This podcast was recorded on Jan. 23, 2017.Michael Douglass:Let's also talking short-term and long-term interest rates. People always talk about interest rates like they're one thing, but there are two different main streams to talk about.John Maxfield: Yeah. If you think about banks, what are banks? The way I like to simplify in my own head, because I have a pretty simple mind [laughs], is that a bank is really nothing more than a retail type of operation, but instead of a bookstore that sells books, banks sell money. And interest rates are the price of money. I.e., when you get a loan, the bank is basically selling you that money to use for a time being. The price that you are paying for that is the interest rate on that. So, as interest rates go up, the price of money goes up. And as the price of money goes up, well, so do bank revenues. So, that is a really good thing. But here's the thing. The banks have been talking now for a few years, waiting for interest rates to come up, hoping for them to come up because profitability in the sector has been so hard. But, in the fourth quarter, when they did come up, the short-term rates didn't come up until December, when the Federal Reserve, the committee that sets monetary policy, when they decided to increase interest rates, that didn't happen until December, so, a little bit more than two-thirds of the way through the quarter.Long-term interest rates, which are also are beneficial to banks, they shot up in the immediate wake of the election, just like bank stocks did. And they shot up, actually, by quite a bit, by 90 basis points. If you talk about that on a percentage basis, that means 0.9%. Now, that doesn't seem like a lot. But if you look at all these banks, in their regulatory filings, put out interest rate sensitivity analysis. And Bank of America(NYSE: BAC)  said that, if short and long-term interest rates increase by 100 basis points, which is almost how much long-term rates shot up, it would earn $5.3 billion more over the following 12 months in net interest income. And net interest income is really high-margin revenue that essentially just falls to the bottom line. Then, we factor in that a bank like Bank of America makes like $5 billion a quarter, then basically, just by interest rates increasing by 1% would basically give Bank of America a full 'nother quarter of earnings on top of what it's already earning. So, it is a really big thing. But, because they came up so late in the quarter, the banks really aren't going to see that benefit until this year. That's why, I think, investors can and should feel bullish about bank stocks at this point.Douglass: Yeah. Certainly, those year-over-year comparisons look like they're going to look pretty darn good for the rest of 2017. Of course, no one has a crystal ball and can predict the future. But that's what things look like right now. But, an interesting thing about interest rates -- and John, you and I were talking about this a bit before the show -- earnings obviously improve as interest rates go up, or they tend to, but book value will tend to go down. Why is that?Maxfield: When you think about what a bank is, it's a highly leveraged investment fund. And in that fund, it holds two different types of assets. I'm speaking very generally. One type of asset are loans. The other type of assets are fixed income securities, things like a 10-year Treasury bill, mortgage-backed securities that are issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, things like that. Well, as interest rates come up, the value of the securities comes down, because those securities were issued under lower interest rates. So, as the new securities, which are basically fungible -- a 10-year Treasury issued in December for all intents and purposes isn't really different from a 10-year Treasury issued in October, except for the fact that if the interest rates go up, investors are going to earn a lot more from those, so they're going to be willing to pay more for those securities that are issued in a higher interest rate environment. What happens then is that all those securities that were existing and on their portfolio, their prices go down.So, what we saw in the fourth quarter was -- and this is a statistic that Dick Bove, a well-known bank analyst, publicized in a recent report, is that if you look at 18 of the biggest banks in the United States, the ones that have thus far reported their earnings, their cumulative book values have fallen by between $17 [billion] to $18 billion. Now, here's the interesting thing about that. You think that there's some give and take here, higher interest rates are good for the income statement but they're bad for the balance sheet. But here's what's so interesting about this. Because of where we are right now, and because the way the regulatory environment has unfolded over the last few years, banks have to hold so much capital that it makes them look less profitable. Because, the way that banks estimate profitability is through the return on equity calculation, where you have income divided by capital. If you have more capital, then your return on equity is going to go down. So, what has happened now is, as these banks have had to revalue their portfolios down, that is actually going to make them look even more profitable, because their return on equity is going to go up. So, there's all these different moving pieces when you're talking about interest rates. Some are good, some are bad. But it looks to me like -- and I think this is probably the consensus out there -- is that as a general rule, higher interest rates are almost indisputably good for banks.John Maxfieldowns shares of Bank of America.

Bank of America

 was because of its dividend. Although this changed during
the financial crisis, when many of the nation's biggest banks
slashed their quarterly payouts in order to accumulate capital,
one of CEO Brian Moynihan's long-stated objectives has been to
restore its once-generous distribution. It's for this reason
that the otherwise ominous chart of Bank of America's quarterly
distributions since the turn of the century is much more
optimistic than one might at first assume.There are two things to take away from this chart. The
first, and most obvious, is the sharp drop that occurred in the
fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009. As
former-CEO Ken Lewis explained in his 2008
letter to shareholders

:In times of severe financial stress, what financial
institutions need more than anything is capital. Bank of
America has, for years, been among the most well-capitalized
banks in the world. But the fourth quarter of 2008 tested
even our ability to maintain a deep well of financial
resources.In early October, to shore up capital levels as credit
losses accelerated, we raised nearly $10 billion through the
sale of common stock and cut our dividend on common stock in
half.The move was difficult, but necessary; it's also not the
most important takeaway from this chart. What's more important
for current investors is Bank of America's previous history of
consistently raising its payout. It did so every year between
the turn of the century and the onset of the crisis eight years
later. In that stretch of time, it went from $0.25 per share
each quarter all the way up to $0.64 per share.And this tells only half the story. If you extend the chart
back three decades, you'd see that Bank of America's tendency
to raise its dividend on an annual basis was a long-established
trend. It had done so every year since 1977, back when Bank of
America was known as North Carolina National Bank.This is all history, of course, but I believe it's just as
relevant today. Current CEO Brian Moynihan made it clear in
2011 that one of his main priorities was to reinstate a
generous dividend payout, as well as to offset the dilution to
its shareholders that occurred in the wake of the crisis. As
Fortune

's Shawn Tully
noted

at the time:In explaining his current strategy, Moynihan divides the
future into two main periods. Over the next two years, he
says, Bank of America will retain virtually all its earnings
to build the funds necessary to comply with the new
Basel III international standards of capital
requirements for financial institutions, which are
anticipated to be stringent. [...]When BofA has built up a sufficient capital cushion,
probably two to three years from now, Moynihan plans to
return all earnings to investors in dividends or share
buybacks -- we're talking about $25 billion a year, all
stuffing shareholders' pockets. ""We need to get back most of
the shares we issued in the crisis, that caused all the
dilution,"" says Moynihan. It's a classic value strategy of
growing modestly without plowing profits back into the
business.The bank has struggled to deliver on this promise, stumbling
through three out of the five stress tests administered by the
Federal Reserve, the results of which dictate whether or not
the nation's biggest banks can return more capital to
shareholders or not. But it finally got the go-ahead in 2014,
increasing its dividend from $0.01 to $0.05 per share.This is just a taste of what's to come. Banks have little
choice but to pay out a significant portion of their earnings
to shareholders. To do otherwise would mean that a bank is
retaining an inordinate share of its earnings. And because
retained earnings increase a bank's shareholders equity, they
have the concomitant effect of decreasing its return on equity,
which is calculated by dividing a bank's net income by its
shareholders equity.The net result is that publicly traded banks have every
incentive to distribute at least a third of their earnings via
dividends, leaving the remaining two-thirds to be split roughly
evenly between share buybacks and retained earnings. Thus, as
Bank of America continues to shore up its balance sheet and
income statement, shareholders can assume that regular dividend
increases will be one of the defining characteristics of the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's stock over the years and
decades to come.The next billion-dollar iSecret

that its high-priced traders can't generate the type of revenue
that's long been expected from trading operations. Image

 is reducing its dependence on trading to generate
profits, as it's parted ways over the past few weeks with
multiple high-level traders. The move makes sense when you
consider that the bank's global markets segment, which houses
its trading operations, also happened to be Bank of America's
least profitable business line in 2015.You can see this in the chart below, which compares the
return on allocated capital earned by Bank of America's four
main operating units. (For the record, the two segments that
are excluded from the chart are the bank's legacy assets and
servicing division, which is responsible for administering
legacy and noncore assets, and its ""all other"" division, a
hodgepodge unit responsible for managing the bank's liquidity
and risk management, among other things.)Based on data from 2015. Data source: Bank of America's
2015 10-K

.The fact that Bank of America's consumer bank is the
standout may come as a surprise. This follows from the fact
that Wall Street traders are generally among the highest paid
people in a financial firm. It would only make sense, in turn,
for their operations to also be the most profitable. Meanwhile,
the least glamorous business line, consumer banking, generates
the highest return on allocated capital despite the fact that
it likely pays its employees significantly less than their Wall
Street counterparts.It could be argued, of course, that trading profits are
merely experiencing a temporary slump. However, there are two
things that seem to suggest this is a more permanent problem.
The first is the fact that new laws and regulations -- the
Volker rule in particular -- have clamped down on proprietary
trading that doesn't involve market making -- that is, buying
and selling securities at a customer's behest.The second thing to keep in mind is that the slump in
trading revenues last year was merely a continuation of
previous years. To this end, 2016 is already on track to mark
the fourth straight year that
Citigroup

's fixed-income and equity trading revenue falls,
says

Bloomberg. Citigroup's chief financial officer John Gerspach
recently disclosed that the bank expects revenue from the unit
to fall by 15% in the first three months of 2016 compared to
the same period last year.This goes a long way toward explaining why Bank of America
parted ways with Kevin Connors, the former global head of
foreign-exchange sales at the bank, as well as Arnaud
Droitcourt, the bank's former head of Asia-Pacific equity
trading. All told, Bank of America is purportedly dismissing
150 trading and investment-banking employees.This may seem like bad news in the short-term, but it may
very well make Bank of America a more stable and
profitable firm over the long run, as highly profitable banks
such as
Wells Fargo

and
US Bancorp

seem to prove that traditional, boring banking is the best way
to consistently generate outsized returns.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

United Kingdom to separate from the European Union (""Brexit"")
will have on the biggest banks in the United States. This is
particularly the case for large international banks with
operations in London and throughout Europe.Given that
Bank of America

(NYSE: BAC) is among these banks, I reached out to one of its
spokesmen to learn how it views the issue internally. He
forwarded the memo that Alex Wilmot-Sitwell, the head of the
bank's European operations, sent to its employees there.Here it is:Dear colleagues,As you are aware, the UK has voted to leave the European
Union.In the coming months, we will get a much clearer
understanding of what the implications of this might be for our
business, as well as the decisions that we will need to make
before the change in membership becomes effective. It is to our
advantage that we work in an organization that has a long track
record of thriving on change -- be it regulatory, market or
strategic. We have already successfully completed the largest
combination of two companies in financial services history. I
am therefore very confident that, when the time comes, we will
again execute our plans efficiently, clearly and
successfully.Our immediate focus however must not be on ourselves but on
ensuring that we are squarely behind our clients during these
unprecedented times. Across each of our areas of business, we
have many clients who will be reflecting on the changes that
they will need to make in the light of the UK's decision. We
must make sure that we are a vital contributor to that
strategic dialogue and the first port of call when they are
ready to transact their business.So today, we must avoid distraction and instead think about
what we can do to help our clients in the short, medium and
longer term. Please make sure that our clients know that we are
all committed to guiding them through the challenges ahead and
that we will do everything we can to make their journey as
seamless as possible. That means that, starting today, it is
business as usual.Thank you for your continued support.AlexThis is how you want a bank to respond. The keys to running a
successful bank are an even-keeled temperament and the ability to
maintain one's composure in unusual times like these. This is
presumably the reason Wilmot-Sitwell stressed that ""starting
today, it is business as usual.""On top of this, as Dick Bove of Rafferty Capital Markets
stressed to me last week, U.S.-based banks which are able to stay
focused on clients could pick up market share from European
competitors that are more deeply embroiled in the turmoil.This isn't to say that Bank of America won't be negatively
impacted by the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union,
because it will be

.An analysis by Keefe, Bruyette & Woods predicted that a
vote in favor of Brexit would reduce Bank of America's earnings
per share by 3.1% this year and by 6.1% in 2017. And CLSA analyst
Mike Mayo sees 10% to 15% downside in earnings per share for the
nation's biggest banks over the next couple years.But the reasons that earnings will fall are largely outside of
Bank of America's control -- namely, higher market volatility
leading to lower trading and investment banking income, and
lower-for-longer interest rates, which will weigh on its net
interest income.For the time being, then, as Wilmot-Sitwell says, it's
business as usual -- albeit in a very unusual environment.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

headquarters after the Federal Reserve released the 2016
stress-test results. Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.It's beer o'clock at
Bank of America

(NYSE: BAC) .The stress test
results

may have been released less than an hour ago, but the executives
at Bank of America are almost certainly already celebrating. For
the first time in three years, the nation's second-biggest bank
by assets passed the first round of the stress test without any
objection from the Federal Reserve.After finishing the day 3% higher, the news sent Bank of
America's shares up an added 1% in after-hours trading. The
results from the second round of the tests, due out next
Wednesday, will dictate whether or not it can raise its dividend,
and/or increase its share-repurchase program, both of which could
further catalyze today's gains.The purpose of the stress test's first round is to determine
whether the nation's biggest banks -- those with more than $50
billion in assets -- have enough capital to survive a severe
economic downturn. The most-extreme scenario in this year's test
presumed, for instance, that unemployment increases to 10%, the
value of stocks and homes fall 50% and 25%, respectively, and
interest rates dip below 0%.Even under these conditions, the Fed was satisfied that Bank
of America has more-than-enough capital to absorb the estimated
$36 billion pre-tax loss that it would suffer over the test's
nine-quarter planning horizon. The North Carolina-based bank
entered the test with an 11.6% tier 1 common-capital ratio, and
emerged with a ratio of 8.1%, which comfortably exceeds the 5.9%
regulatory minimum that it reported in its latest 10-Q.The lion's share of Bank of America's projected losses stemmed
from its loan portfolio. According to the Fed, the bank would
have to set aside $59.2 billion to cover loan losses. That's $10
billion more than last year. The Fed also estimated that Bank of
America would lose $20 billion as a result of its trading and
counterparty activities, a $2.4 billion increase over 2015.Even more importantly, the Fed didn't take issue with Bank of
America's capital-planning process, which is what tripped the
bank up the last two years. In 2014, it was forced to resubmit
its capital plan after belatedly discovering that it had
mismarked securities inherited in its 2008 acquisition of Merrill
Lynch. And in 2015, the Fed required Bank of America ""to submit a
new capital plan ... to address certain weaknesses in its capital
planning processes.""I'm happy to say that Bank of America's performance this year
didn't come as a total shock. Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan
made it a priority since taking the helm in 2010 to build up the
bank's balance sheet. Under his watch, Bank of America's tangible
common equity has grown by $50 billion. And it's done so at the
same time that it's had to absorb upwards of $200 billion worth
of financial-crisis-related expenses.Additionally, while Bank of America's profitability still lags
many of its peers, as well as its own cost of capital, last year
was the first time in nearly a decade that it strung together
four-consecutive calendar quarters of respectable profits. Its
nearly $16 billion in net income last year was enough to place it
11th on Forbes list of companies ranked by their 2015
profits.This by no means marks the end of Bank of America's reascent
to the apex of global finance; but it's an important step along
the way. It also adds another reason to think that the $2.2
trillion bank has finally put the worst of the financial crisis
in the rearview mirror.Shareholders should tune in next Wednesday to learn whether
Bank of America will be permitted by the Fed to increase its
dividend and/or its share-buyback program, which is determined in
the comprehensive capital analysis and review process. Three
weeks after that, on July 18, the bank reports second-quarter
earnings.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

reported that
Bank of America Corporation

(
BAC

) is yet again planning to cut jobs. The latest decision will lead
to the elimination of about 400 employees in its high earning
operations.However, this is not part of Project BAC, under which BofA
planned to remove about 30,000 workers and reduce expenses by $5
billion per year by 2014 in Phase 1.The latest downsizing will mainly occur in BofA's commercial
banking, investment banking and non-U.S. wealth-management units.
These businesses had significantly expanded following the company
acquisition of Merrill Lynch & Co. in 2009.This time, the target employees are involved in BofA's most
profitable businesses. It was the effort of these employees that
Merrill Lynch became an important part of the company's turnaround
story following the financial crisis.However, BofA's decision to slash experienced workforce from its
profitable businesses will aid the young and inexperienced
investment-banking employees in gain more experience. Moreover,
they can be positioned in any of the company's different industry
sectors depending on need.Moreover, BofA's planned sale of its international wealth
management units will lead to about 2,000 job eliminations across
Asia, Europe and Latin America. The company has been trying to
divest these operations in a bid to further streamline its
operations and focus on its core businesses.Many other global banks are trying to control expenses through
downsizing and divestitures. Last month,
HSBC Holdings Plc.

(
HBC

) announced job cuts in the UK as part of its strategy to reduce
costs. HSBC will retrench 30,000 employees by the end of 2013. HSBC
has also been divesting and closing its unprofitable and non-core
businesses.ConclusionThe latest endeavor by BofA to trim down its staff shows its
effort to control expenses amidst the struggling U.S. economy and
the highly regulated banking industry. These factors had negatively
impacted the company's revenues, which fell nearly 22% in the last
three years.Divestitures and expense reductions are not the only actions
that BofA has been taking. The company is also investing in its
franchise in the high growth regions and markets across the globe.
International growth remains one of its top priorities.
Additionally, clearing the stress test authenticates BofA's strong
capital position and its ability to successfully overcome another
severe economic downturn.Currently, BofA retains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a
short-term 'Hold' rating. Also, considering the fundamentals, we
maintain our long-term ""Neutral"" recommendation on the stock.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Investing,Business,Stocks","BAC","[{'news_title': 'You are a CEO, but are you doing the job?', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/you-are-a-ceo-but-are-you-doing-the-job-cm945551', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad475583efc2c2bde3fbd61'}}, {'news_title': '2 Ways Public-Private Partnerships Are Spurring Economic Development', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/2-ways-publicprivate-partnerships-are-spurring-economic-development-cm944314', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad475583efc2c2bde3fbd62'}}, {'news_title': 'Should You Reward Employees In The Wake Of The Tax Bill?', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/should-you-reward-employees-in-the-wake-of-the-tax-bill-cm943488', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad475583efc2c2bde3fbd63'}}]","{'$date': '2012-05-01T16:30:01Z'}"

Image source: Bank of America.In a recent interview on CNBC, Bank of America's(NYSE: BAC) chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan discussed a range of topics. At the top of the list was the same topic that coursed through the 56-year-old executive's annual letter to shareholdersthis year: growing responsibly.""When we look at where we stand today, our company is stronger, simpler, and better positioned to deliver long-term value to our shareholders, thanks to the straightforward way in which we serve our customers and clients,"" he wrote. ""The path forward is clearly one of responsible growth.""Moynihan doubled down on this in his CNBC interview on Thursday, saying:The question right now is: Can we grow and be responsible? Our industry and company have a history of growing in the good times by reaching for credit, reaching for terms, things like that. So we've basically driven this idea of responsible growth. You have to grow, no excuses, but you have to do it the right way.What does he mean by this?This may seem like a circular answer, but he means Bank of America learned during and after the 2008 financial crisis that it's unwise to pursue growth at all costs -- i.e., irresponsible growth. That's what Moynihan is referring to in the passage above when he talks about reaching for credit and terms, by which he means lowering credit standards in order to fuel loan growth.Bank of America was guilty of this when it came to credit cards in the lead-up to the crisis. ""In the boom we pushed cards through the branches and in mass mailings,"" Moynihan told Fortune's Shawn Tully in 2011. ""To drive growth we gave cards to people who couldn't afford them.""The damage was considerable. Based on an analysisI did two years ago, it cost Bank of America roughly $60 billion in losses from soured credit card loans.The solution to this problem, Moynihan went on to explain to CNBC's Wilfred Frost, is to focus on organic growth -- that is, to deepen relationships with existing customers as opposed to going out and trying to get new ones. Here's the example he shared to illustrate this:Out of 10 customers who get a mortgage, who are Bank of America customers that fully fit out credit requirements, only three of them get it with us. It used to be two, so we've moved that up dramatically. When we're at nine or 10, that's an interesting question, but between three and nine, there's plenty of opportunity to grow and stay within that credit quality.This is a catch-22 for shareholders. It's good because it implies that Bank of America will avoid the types of aggressive growth tactics that got it into so much trouble a decade ago. But it's bad because it means Bank of America won't grow as aggressively.Fortunately, the issue facing Bank of America right now is less about growth, and more about interest rates and profitability. Higher interest rates alone could boost Bank of America's share price from less than $16 today to upwards of $20 a share or more, which would still be below its book value per share.Growth or no growth, then, there's reason right now to be bullish on Bank of America stock.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

take advantage of the digital revolution. At the forefront of
this movement is
Bank of America

(NYSE: BAC) , which has placed first in terms of mobile banking
in two out of the past three
Keynote Scorecards

, which rank banks based on consumer-facing digital
capabilities.Bank of America's latest quarterly results,
released at the beginning of this week

, underscore this point. As you can see in the three charts
below, the nation's second-biggest bank by assets continues to
make considerable strides on the mobile-banking front.Bank of America ended the second quarter with 20.2 million
regular users of its mobile app. That represented a 6% increase
from the first quarter, and a 15% increase over the year-ago
period.Data source: Bank of America's 2Q16 earnings presentation.The popularity of Bank of America's mobile app goes beyond
simply using it to check one's checking account balance. In
addition to depositing checks, which I expand on below, customers
are also using the bank's digital channels to schedule
appointments at one of the bank's branches. An estimated 289,000
digital appointments were scheduled at the bank in the second
quarter.This illustrates the importance of having both physical and
digital delivery channels. It also cuts down on the demand for
call centers, which should play into Bank of America's goal to
reduce annual expenses by an additional $3
billion by 2018

.One of the most-popular features of modern banking apps is the
ability to deposit checks remotely, as opposed to having to drive
to a branch or an ATM to do so. In the most-recent quarter, more
than 20 million checks were deposited via Bank of America's
mobile app.So many of Bank of America's customers are using its app to
deposit checks, that the mobile channel now accounts for a
meaningful portion of its total deposit transactions. Mobile
deposits made up 17% of its total deposit transactions in the
three months ended June 30.Data source: Bank of America's 2Q16 earnings presentation.As CEO Brian Moynihan pointed out on
Bank of America's earnings call

, this equates to 800 physical branches, which, suffice it to
say, are more expensive to operate than a mobile application.
According to Moynihan, a mobile deposit costs one-tenth that of
an in-branch deposit.The final chart illustrates just how thoroughly the
mobile-banking revolution has changed the way financial products
and services are delivered. It shows the average number of weekly
interactions that Bank of America has with its customers by
delivery channel.Data source: Bank of America's 2Q16 earnings presentation.In a typical week, as you can see, Bank of America's customers
log into its mobile app 72 million times, its website 40 million
times, and visit its financial centers 6 million times. This
explains why mobile banking is such a priority at Bank of
America.To this end, Bank of America will soon release a redesigned
mobile app. In addition to an ""improved layout and easier-to-use
and easier-to-find features,"" it will also offer new credit-card
features, and purportedly, the functionality to use the app in
lieu of a debit card to withdraw money from an ATM.In short, while tracking Bank of America's progress on the
mobile-banking front probably doesn't rank at the top of most
investors' and analysts' priorities, this doesn't mean that it's
not important. Staying at the forefront of the digital-banking
revolution will not only help the bank attract and retain
customers, it will also help it to reduce expenses, which has
become an increasingly important priority in an era of ultra-low
interest rates.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

Bank of America Corporation

(
BAC

) is finally divesting its international wealth management
operations to Switzerland-based private bank, Julius Baer Group,
for nearly CHF860 million ($882 million).The decision to offload these units is a part of BofA's
long-term strategy to build up capital and divest its non-core and
unprofitable businesses.Moreover, the transaction would further diversify Julius Baer
footprints in faster growing emerging markets − Asia, Latin America
and the Middle East.



To finance its agreement with BofA, apart from terminating the
share repurchase authorization, Julius Baer will utilize the
available cash (CHF 530 million) and raise nearly CHF750 million
through rights issue. The total cash thus accumulated will be used
to consummate the aforesaid deal and also fund future acquisitions.



BofA has been actively divesting its non-core and unprofitable
operations since the last two years. The company has been doing so
in order to recover from losses related to its acquisition of
Countrywide Financial in 2008 and meet regulatory capital
requirements.



Since the beginning of 2010, BofA has completed the divestiture of
more than 20 non-core asset as part of an overall strategy to
streamline its operations. All these initiatives, along with
Project New BAC are expected to boost the company's capital ratios.
As of June 30, 2012, Tier 1 common capital ratio under Basel III
was estimated at 8.10%.



Currently, BofA retains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a
short-term Hold rating. Also, considering the fundamentals, we

this week we highlight one interesting put contract, and one
interesting call contract, from the January 2017 expiration for
BAC. The put contract our YieldBoost algorithm identified as
particularly interesting, is at the $10 strike, which has a bid at
the time of this writing of 24 cents. Collecting that bid as the
premium represents a 2.4% return against the $10 commitment, or a
2.3% annualized rate of return (at Stock Options Channel we call
this the
YieldBoost

call contract of particular interest for the January 2017
expiration, for shareholders of Bank of America Corp. (Symbol: BAC)
looking to boost their income beyond the stock's 1.3% annualized
dividend yield. Selling the covered call at the $20 strike and
collecting the premium based on the 32 cents bid, annualizes to an
additional 2.1% rate of return against the current stock price
(this is what we at Stock Options Channel refer to as the
YieldBoost

), for a total of 3.4% annualized rate in the scenario where the
stock is not called away. Any upside above $20 would be lost if the
stock rises there and is called away, but BAC shares would have to
advance 32% from current levels for that to occur, meaning that in
the scenario where the stock is called, the shareholder has earned
a 34.1% return from this trading level, in addition to any

has substantially increased its asset and wealth management
business over the last decade, spurred on by its
2008 acquisition of Merrill Lynch

as well as the introduction of Merrill Edge, a wealth
management product targeted at mass affluent customers.This is an interesting move, as asset and wealth management
businesses offer notoriously low margins compared to other
financial products and services. You can see this in the table
below, which compares the profit margins of Bank of America's
four main operating divisions: consumer banking, global wealth
and investment management (GWIM), global banking, and global
markets.Operating DivisionProfit Margin (3Q15)Global Banking48%Consumer Banking35%Global Markets33%GWIM23%Data source: Bank of America's
3Q15 financial supplement

, page 16.It should be clear from this table that Bank of America's
most profitable operating division is its global banking unit,
from which it generates an impressive 48% profit margin.
Following that are its consumer banking and global markets
units, with margins of 35% and 33%, respectively. And trailing
far behind is GWIM, which a profit margin of only 23%.From this comparison, it's obvious that asset and wealth
management services aren't only less profitable than Bank of
America's other products and services, they're
much less

profitable, with a combined margin that's less than half as
wide as global banking's.Making up for the lack of margins, however, are three
important points. The first is that Bank of America's other
business lines benefit from cross selling to GWIM customers. In
the first six months of the year, $1.8 billion worth of client
assets migrated from GWIM to other business, consisting of
deposits, loans, and assets held in brokerage accounts.The second point is that the GWIM business exposes Bank of
America to minimal credit risk --
the risk that loans will default

-- the scourge of a bank's existence when the economy takes a
turn for the worse. The assets administered by GWIM are ""assets
under management,"" and not actually held on Bank of America's
balance sheet. The original owners retain title to the assets
and bear the risk that they will decline in value.Finally, revenue from managing assets is typically less
volatile than revenue from other types of financial products
and services. You can see this in the chart below, which shows
the quarterly revenue fluctuations in three of Bank of
America's fee-based businesses: cards, investment and brokerage
(i.e., GWIM), and trading.Stability in this regard not only boosts a bank's share
price, but it also, at least theoretically, helps a bank
perform well on the
stress tests

administered by the Federal Reserve each year. One of the
objectives of the stress tests is to project what will happen
to a bank's revenue and earnings in the event of a severe
economic downturn akin to the
financial crisis

. As asset and wealth management revenue is likely to hold up
better than other divisions -- and particularly those exposed
to credit risk -- it offers a solid foundation upon which to
generate capital even when other businesses are burning through
it.In sum, Bank of America's strategic focus on asset and
wealth management should, given time, make it a stronger, more
profitable, and more reliable company for investors to own
shares of, despite the fact that the business line itself
offers otherwise dismal margins.The next billion-dollar iSecret

move defies logic.The implication that Bank of America's stock was overweight
before the drop -- meaning that it appeared to offer a better
value than other stocks -- but neutral now doesn't make sense.
At the end of last year, Bank of America's shares traded for an
8%
premium

to the bank's tangible book value. Fast forward to today and
its shares trade for a 28%
discount

to tangible book value -- and that's after Tuesday's 5%
increase.If you think about this logically, the drop in Bank of
America's stock indicates two things. First, as my colleague
Rich Smith
pointed out

, it means there's a larger margin for error if you were to buy
the bank's stock today relative to two months ago. This isn't
to say that Bank of America's stock couldn't fall further,
because it could. But it's in the bargain bin as is, and its
markdown is already very steep.The second and related point is that Bank of America's stock
is less risky today than it was at the end of last year. Risk
boils down to how much an investor stands to lose by buying a
stock. Doing so after a stock has fallen is thus necessarily
less risky than buying it at its peak. This makes sense in
theory, but our emotions lead us in the opposite direction, as
we tend to underestimate risk when stocks are soaring and
overestimate it when they're crashing.It was this exact type of behavior that gave Warren Buffett
an opening to buy shares of
Wells Fargo

at the beginning of the 1990s. There was a widespread belief at
the time among analysts that banks were in trouble thanks to a
downturn in the commercial real estate market. A prominent
writer for
The New York Times

even
intimated

that the bank industry could ""go the way of the savings and
loans, becoming a government ward.""This void gave Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway

the opportunity to become Wells Fargo's biggest shareholder at
a steep discount to its historical valuation. ""Our purchases of
Wells Fargo in 1990 were helped by a chaotic market in bank
stocks,"" Buffett
wrote

at the time.The disarray was appropriate: Month by month the foolish
loan decisions of once well-regarded banks were put on public
display. As one huge loss after another was unveiled-often on
the heels of managerial assurances that all was
well-investors understandably concluded that no bank's
numbers were to be trusted. Aided by their flight from bank
stocks, we purchased our 10% interest in Wells Fargo for $290
million, less than five times after-tax earnings, and less
than three times pre-tax earnings.Getting back to Bank of America, then, it's worth keeping in
mind that the bank has meaningfully improved its operations and
profitability over the past year. Its 2015 results marked the
first time since the financial crisis that it reported four
consecutive calendar quarters of respectable profits, producing
its highest annual earnings in nearly a decade.Just as significantly, Bank of America was able to partially
slay two particularly pernicious demons last year. First, a
judicial decision in the second quarter allowed the bank to
slash its outstanding legal liabilities by $7.6 billion
dollars. The holding also reduced the inflow of new
crisis-related claims from around $2 billion a quarter to
roughly $200 million. And second, Bank of America's debt rating
was increased by a notch, which will ultimately result in a
lower cost of funds and thus higher profits at the Charlotte,
North Carolina-based bank.To be fair, the world economy
is

in disarray. China's economy is teetering on the brink of an
economic cataclysm, evidenced by the recent decision of its
central bank to ease bank reserve requirements in an effort to
reignite lending. Europe is also perched on the precipice of an
unknown disaster, with voters in the United Kingdom set to vote
in June on whether to remain in the European Union. And 
oil
prices

continue to spur fear among investors that banks could soon see
a wave of defaults emanating out from the energy industry.But with the exception of the upcoming referendum in the
United Kingdom, none of these concerns are new. And the fact
that Bank of America's shares already trade for a substantial
discount to tangible book value suggests to me that the
potential fallout from these events have been priced into Bank
of America's stock. This isn't to say that they won't fall
further, but they certainly look cheap to me.In short, investors shouldn't allow themselves to be swayed
by a belated downgrade of Bank of America's shares at the very
same time that savvy investors see them as a bargain.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

bank stocks

, the term ""net interest margin"" will come up time and again
throughout your research into the industry.It measures how much a bank earns from the age-old practice
of borrowing money from depositors and other types of
institutional investors and then investing that money into
higher-yielding interest-earning assets like loans and
fixed-income securities (principally bonds).In the most recent quarter, for example,
Bank of America

's net interest margin came in at 2.37%.This is calculated in two steps. The first step is take the
difference between what the Charlotte, North Caroline-based
bank earned from its $1.8 trillion dollars' worth of
interest-earning assets and what it paid out on the debt used
to finance the assets.You can find this information in a bank's regulatory filings
(available from the SEC's
EDGAR

database) contained in a table titled ""Quarterly Average
Balances and Interest Rates"" -- go to pages 22-25 in Bank of
America's
latest 10-Q

to follow along.For the three months ended June 30, 2015, Bank of America
generated $13.4 billion dollars in interest income from its
$881 billion loan portfolio and roughly $1 trillion from its
portfolio of securities and other assets. To finance these
holdings, it paid $2.6 billion in interest expense. The
difference between the two, known as ""net interest income,"" is
$10.8 billion.If you then multiply this figure by four -- to reflect the
fact that there are four quarters in a fiscal year -- you get
$43.2 billion in ""annualized"" net interest income.Now that we have this, we can move on to the second step in
the analysis. That is, to divide Bank of America's annualized
net interest income by its $1.8 trillion in average earning
assets. This gives us Bank of America's 2.37% net interest
margin.To say that this is an important metric for bankers and bank
stock investors would be an understatement. Even our
biggest banks

, with their wide diversity of fee-generating businesses, still
earn around half their revenue from the difference between
their yield on earning assets and their cost of funds.Bank of America derives 47% of its net revenue from this.
Wells Fargo

, a more traditional savings and loan operation, gets 53%.But while the goal of any bank is to maximize its net
interest margin, it's important to appreciate that doing so
comes at a cost. This is because a high yield on earning assets
relative to the industry almost necessarily means that a bank
is taking on more risk than its peers.Additionally, much of a bank's net interest income is a
function of short-term interest rate benchmarks such as the
London Interbank Offered Rate in Europe or the Federal Funds
rate here in the United States. When these are high a typical
bank will earn more from its assets than when rates are
low.The latter is where we find ourselves today. Since the
financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has kept short-term rates
just above 0%. If these increase by only a single percentage
point, Bank of America
projects

that it will earn $4.6 billion more in annual net interest
income. This is high margin income because it takes no added
expense to generate.In short,
and particularly right now

, it's important that bank investors appreciate the role that
the net interest margin will play in terms of both
profitability and shareholder returns over the foreseeable
future.This $19 trillion industry could destroy the

Bank of America

learned last month that the financial crisis has cost the
nation's second-biggest bank by assets approximately $195
billion.To put that in perspective, Bank of America entered the
crisis with only $137 billion worth of capital. It's clear,
then, that if the federal government hadn't stepped in to
rescue the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender with more
than $45 billion, then Bank of America would have long since
ceased to exist.Data source: Bank of America's
presentation

 (slide 6) at the 2015 Barclays Global Financial Services
Conference. Chart by author.What's so interesting about Bank of America's crisis-related
expenses is the fact that they seem to have caught the bank by
surprise. As late as 2011, CEO Brian Moynihan predicted that it
would earn between $35 billion and $40 billion in pre-tax
profits. But in the three full years since then, it has
actually earned an annual average of only $8.7 billion before
taxes.How could Moynihan have gotten it so wrong? The answer is
that most of the expenses stemmed from fines and legal
settlements related to mortgage-backed securities, which, in
turn, had been stuffed with subprime mortgages. Because Bank of
America had previously sold these securities to institutional
investors, and the securities themselves were thus no longer on
its balance sheet, the bank seems to have convinced itself that
the liability for the loans was no longer its responsibility,
either.Bank of America's chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan. Image
source: Getty Images News/Thinkstock.There was one problem with this. When Bank of America -- or,
more specifically, Countrywide Financial, which the bank
acquired in 2008 -- packaged the loans into securities, it
agreed to repurchase them if the buyers could show that the
mortgages didn't abide by responsible underwriting standards.
Known as representation and warranties claims, these have cost
the bank $28 billion since 2008. And when you add the $36
billion in ancillary legal expenses to this, you get $64
billion in ""off-balance-sheet"" risk.Furthermore, if you throw in the $46 billion in expenses
from Bank of America's legacy assets and servicing unit, which
was tasked with servicing the repurchased mortgages, then you
get a total of $110 billion in crisis-related expenses that
would have been difficult, if not impossible, to predict
without the benefit of hindsight.In fact, even if you add the entire $195 billion back into
Bank of America's pre-tax earnings, it's still less than the
$35 billion to $40 billion figure cited by Moynihan four years
ago.Data source: Bank of America, YCharts.com, author's
estimates. Chart by author.None of this is offered for the purpose of criticizing
Moynihan, who has done a commendable job turning the $2.2
trillion bank around over the last five and a half years. It's
offered instead to show how unpredictable the future can be.
Indeed, even the person best positioned to make a prediction
about the future course of events -- in this case, Moynihan --
couldn't offer an estimate that was even in the same ballpark
as reality.The next billion-dollar iSecret

performance, then
Bank of America

's CEO Brian Moynihan seems uniquely positioned to deliver the
once-ailing lender to the promised land of higher profits and
greater shareholder returns

.I'm referring specifically to Moynihan's time at FleetBoston
Financial, where he worked for a decade before the New
England-based bank merged with Bank of America in 2003.Like other banks around the turn of the century, FleetBoston
found itself in trouble:It wrote off more than $1 billion in losses on loans to
Argentina, which defaulted on its debts in 2001.The U.S. economy was reeling from the bursting of the
dot-com bubble and the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001.Multiple corporate clients of FleetBoston went bankrupt
-- namely, Enron, United Airlines, and TXU, an energy
services company.And the bank's reputation among consumers was the second
worst in the industry, according to Consumer Reports.As a result, FleetBoston's return on average assets, one of
the most important profitability ratios in the industry,
dropped from 1.66% in 2000 all the way down to 0.48% the
following year. That meant it was earning roughly half as much
as a bank its size would under normal circumstances.FleetBoston's CEO, Charles Gifford, responded by emphasizing
consumer banking, a ""bright spot"" for the industry at the time.
It added tellers, remodeled branches, wooed a top consumer
strategist from
Wells Fargo

, and unveiled a $70 million advertising campaign to revitalize
its image.But even though this strategy improved profits over the
following two years, FleetBoston nonetheless succumbed to the
temptation to merge with the bigger and stronger Bank of
America, which had been created only five years earlier through
the combination of North Carolina's NationsBank and
California's Bank of America.Gifford became the chairman of the board while Bank of
America's Ken Lewis retained his position as CEO. Moynihan,
meanwhile, began cycling through executive positions in the
combined bank's principal business units.By serving as Mr. Fix It, Moynihan did for his boss what
Lewis had done for his predecessor, Hugh McColl, the longtime
NationsBank CEO who spearheaded the bank consolidation wave of
the 1990s. It was this experience, as well as legacy
FleetBoston's plurality of votes on Bank of America's board,
that catapulted Moynihan into the corner office of the nation's
second biggest bank by assets.Bank of America's
current turnaround

is thus far from Moynihan's first rodeo. Whether he can do for
the $2.2 trillion bank today what he helped accomplish at
FleetBoston over a decade ago remains to be see, but
shareholders can take comfort in the fact that he's been here
before.This $19 trillion industry could destroy the

share.This isn't as bad as it looks. The second quarter of 2015 was
Bank of America's best quarterly performance in almost five
years. Fueled by lower legal and operational expenses, the North
Carolina-based bank earned $5.3 billion during the three-month
stretch, though $700 million of that came from favorable
market-related adjustments to its net interest income.""Solid core loan growth, higher mortgage originations and the
lowest expenses since 2008 contributed to our strongest earnings
in several years, as we continued to build broader and deeper
relationships with our customers and clients,"" said Chairman
and CEO Brian Moynihan at the time. ""We also benefited from the
improvement in the U.S. economy, where we are particularly well
positioned.""But a lot has happened since then. While the Federal Reserve
increased interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point in
December, it later
abandoned

any pretensions of going further after jobs growth in May
increased at the slowest rate in half a decade.This is particularly bad news for Bank of America given that
it's positioned to benefit the most of any big bank from an
increase in interest rates. The bank estimates that a
100-basis-point (1%) increase in short- and long-term rates would
boost its annual net interest income by $6 billion. Without this,
there's little hope that Bank of America can earn the 12% or so
return on equity that's needed to create value for
shareholders.The vote in the United Kingdom at the end of June to separate
from the European Union
made things worse

. The economic tumult that followed will buttress the Fed's
decision to proceed cautiously with rate increases. The vote in
favor of Brexit is also likely to weigh on Bank of America's
capital markets business -- its trading and investment banking
units -- which suffers in the face of excess uncertainty and
volatility.Investors got
a taste of this

in the first quarter, when concerns about economic growth in
China, low oil and gas prices, and the pending referendum in the
United Kingdom sent capital markets revenues tumbling across Wall
Street. Bank of America led the way with a 16% drop in
first-quarter trading revenue, followed by a 13% fall at
Citigroup

and an 11% decline at
JPMorgan Chase

.Fortunately, because the Brexit vote took place in the final
two weeks of the second quarter, there's reason to believe that
prior forecasts of an improvement in trading income may still
have come to fruition. Earlier in the quarter, Moynihan predicted
a mid-single-digit year-over-year increase in quarterly trading
revenue. Executives at JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup followed with
their own predictions of improved trading results.Analysts nevertheless
dropped their earnings estimates

for Bank of America in the wake of the U.K. vote. Since the
referendum on June 23, analysts have lowered the bank's EPS
estimate by 8%. That's a bigger drop than any other bank. The
runner-up, Citigroup, saw analysts cut their forecasts by an
average of 5%.There's also reason to believe that Bank of America's earnings
will be hit by a $415 million fine from the SEC during the
quarter that settled allegations that Merrill Lynch ""misused
customer cash to generate profits for the firm and failed to
safeguard customer securities from the claims of its creditors.""
The impact on Bank of America's bottom line will depend on
whether, and to what extent, it had previously set aside money to
cover the settlement.Like the other major lenders, Bank of America is also facing
headwinds from
higher losses in its loan portfolio

-- and particularly from loans to energy companies, which are
struggling against low oil and gas prices. Loan loss provisions
in its global banking segment quintupled in the first quarter,
going from $96 million in the year-ago period to $553 million in
the first three months of 2016.The one bright spot may be loan growth. ""Growth has been more
or less strong across the board, including commercial and
industrial loans, real estate and credit cards,""
wrote
The Wall Street Journal

 earlier this month. ""As long as the economy keeps chugging
along, this should continue.""Either way, it's no longer the current quarter that's on
investors' minds, but rather what lies ahead for Bank of America.
The bank has taken meaningful strides over the last few years to
mop up legal liability and excess costs stemming from the
financial crisis -- adding up to $200 billion overall. But even
after this progress is taken into account, Bank of America has
nevertheless struggled to generate the kind of profitability that
investors expect.Higher interest rates will close much of the gap between
investor expectations and Bank of America's actual profitability.
But with those now pushed off even further into the future,
there's little reason to be optimistic about the bank's
short-term prospects -- for either its bottom line or for the
still incredibly low valuation on its stock. Its shares trade for
a 40% discount to book value. Shares of Wells Fargo, meanwhile,
trade for a 40% premium to its book value.The storyline for Bank of America's investors this quarter is
thus much the same: wait and see. There will come a time when the
path is clear for Bank of America and other banks to earn a lot
more money. As to when that will happen, however, no one knows.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

The biggest risk of all is the stringent regulatory regime that's only bound to get worse in the wake of Wells Fargo's massive fraud.Banks have always been tightly regulated. Four decades ago, they weren't even allowed to have multiple branches or to operate in multiple states. And for 60 years after the Great Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act prohibited banks from running both commercial and investment banking businesses, as it was believed that the combination contributed to the banking crises of the 1930s.These rules began to ease up in the 1970s, culminating in a series of laws passed in the 1990s that eliminated most of the restrictions. It was this deregulation that enabled Bank of America to grow into what it is today -- a $2.2 trillion bank with branches stretched across the country.Unfortunately for bankers, however, the financial crisis in 2008 put an end to this trend. Thanks to the role of banks in both the housing bubble and its collapse, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010. The legislation marks a swing of the pendulum back in the direction of heavy regulation.The new rules fall especially hard on the country's eight global systemically important banks. These include the four largest commercial banks ( JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and Citigroup), two major custodial banks ( The Bank of New York Mellonand State Street), and the two biggest stand-alone investment banks ( Goldman Sachsand Morgan Stanley).These eight banks must hold more capital than their peers, which necessarily reduces their leverage and thus their profitability. They must also keep their balance sheets more liquid than their smaller, simpler peers in the regional banking space. This depresses the yield on a bank's asset portfolio and thus weighs on a bank's top and bottom lines.Large banks must also ask for the Federal Reserve's permission to increase their dividends or boost their share repurchase authorizations. This is part of the annual stress tests mandated by Dodd Frank. And while most banks tend to have their capital proposals approved, Bank of America has been rebuked by the central bank on multiple occasions over the past six years.The most significant change of all, however, has been the animosity that politicians and regulators have directed toward the banks in the wake of the crisis. On Thursday of this week, during the second round of Congressional hearings into the Wells Fargo scandal, multiple members of the House of Representatives argued that the biggest banks should be broken up.And they weren't alone. In the months leading up to the hearing, two of the Federal Reserve's governors hinted that they feel the same way. ""I think it likely that firms are going to have to change in some cases their size, in some cases their business model, and in some cases their organization,"" Daniel Tarullo told The Wall Street Journalin May.Tarullo's colleague, Jerome Powell, echoed this sentiment. ""I have not reached any conclusion that a particular bank needs to be broken up or anything like that,"" Powell said at a conference around the same time. The point is instead to ""raise capital requirements to the point at which it becomes a question that banks have to ask themselves.""Them are fighting words. And they represent the scariest thing about Bank of America's stock. If it's broken up by regulators, there's no telling whether shareholders will benefit or suffer from the move.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

Bank of America

's shares fell sharply over the last few days. The fact of the
matter is that the $2.2 trillion bank is in the best shape it's
been in for nearly a decade.The market's declines on Thursday and Friday seem to stem
from
China's decision

to devalue its currency, the yuan. Not only will this
effectively reduce the price of products manufactured in China
relative to products produced elsewhere, but even more
importantly it seems to suggest that the East Asian giant may
be in a worse economic position than previously assumed.This isn't good for the global economy, and it isn't good
for Bank of America. While the Charlotte, North Carolina-based
bank purports to have only
$12 billion

in direct exposure to China, an economic cataclysm in Asia
would reverberate throughout the entire world.Yet, I still believe that Bank of America is in a better
position today than it's been in since the
financial crisis

. And I also believe that the valuation of its shares, and
particularly after last week's decline, isn't reflecting the
three things that matter most to the megabank right now.First, Bank of America's credit rating was
increased

by all three of the nation's leading ratings agencies last
quarter. If this trend continues, it isn't unreasonable to
think that the nation's second biggest bank by assets could
earn $2 billion more a year over the foreseeable future with
little to no added effort or expense.In the second quarter of this year, Bank of America paid an
annualized interest rate of 2.2% to borrow $240 billion in
long-term debt. Meanwhile, the higher-rated
Wells Fargo

paid only 1.32%. If Bank of America had faced the same rate
over the past year, holding all else equal, its pre-tax income
would have increased by 24%.Second, a
legal decision

handed down by New York's highest court in June allowed Bank of
America to reduce its estimate of outstanding legal liabilities
by $7.6 billion. It also throttled the inflow of new claims
against the bank. An average of $2.6 billion worth of fresh
claims were filed against Bank of America in each of the four
quarters preceding the decision. But this dropped to only $224
million in its wake.Billions of dollars that were once consumed by legal
expenses are thus finally free to hit Bank of America's bottom
line. Not only will this reduce the uncertainty weighing on the
valuation of its shares -- based on Friday's closing price,
they trade for a 24% discount to book value -- it will also
fuel Bank of America's
return on equity

, which, in turn, should filter through to its stock price (to
learn about return on equity as well as bank stock valuations,
scroll through the following slideshow).Finally, if you listen to Bank of America's latest
conference call

, one thing stands out from the rest. Namely, CEO Brian
Moynihan focused his prepared comments on revenue growth,
departing from previous calls where he spent the majority of
his time discussing expenses and
legal risk

.To be clear, this isn't the first time that Moynihan has
hinted that Bank of America's worst days are behind it. At the
bank's investor day in March 2011, Moynihan predicted that it
would soon earn between $35 billion and $40 billion on an
annual pre-tax basis. Fast forward to 2014, and it generated
only $6.9 billion in earnings before taxes.But far from eroding Moynihan's credibility, I believe his
past mistakes, and the public indignation suffered because of
them, have most likely tempered his optimism. Regardless of
what you think of the 55-year-old bank chief, he's
incredibly astute

. If anything, then, the recent change in his tone probably
understates the opportunities that lie ahead for Bank of
America.In sum, I believe that Bank of America's shares are a
bargain compared to
other banks

. This is particularly true after last week's 10% rout. I could
be wrong, and I apologize if I am, but that's my honest
opinion.The next billion-dollar iSecret

Its chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan, made this point soon after taking over at the bank, and he doubled down on it in his latest shareholder letter, released Wednesday, saying that the bank is focused on steadily repurchasing the 7 billion shares it issued during the financial crisis.So here's the big question for shareholders of the nation's second biggest bank by assets: How much stock is it currently buying back? The answer is: a lot, but not as much as the bank would like to, given its still-low share price.Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author.In 2016, Bank of America spent $5.1 billion on buybacks. That was enough to repurchase 332,750 shares of stock. That's a fraction of its 10.1 billion outstanding shares, and an even smaller fraction of its 11 billion outstanding shares if unexercised options are factored into the equation, but it's nevertheless a step toward Moynihan's goal.It's worth pointing out, as well, that 2016 was the fourth year in a row that Bank of America bought back stock. All told, over this stretch, the bank has spent $12.4 billion on common stock repurchases, reducing its share count by 6% from a peak of 11.7 billion diluted shares outstanding in the wake of the crisis.Buybacks like these are especially valuable for Bank of America, given that its shares trade at the third lowest valuation among large-cap bank stocks, behind only Citigroupand Capital One. Just like an ordinary investor, this is when a bank, or any company for that matter, gets the best bang for its buck from purchasing shares.Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America.None other than Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) , which happens to be one of Bank of America's largest shareholders, expressed his support for the bank's buyback policy in his own annual letterto shareholders this year:Many of our investees, including Bank of America, have been repurchasing shares, some quite aggressively. We very much like this behavior because we believe the repurchased shares have in most cases been underpriced. (Undervaluation, after all, is why we own these positions.) When a company grows and outstanding shares shrink, good things happen for shareholders.It may go without saying, but the more stock Bank of America can continue buying at these prices, the better off its shareholders will be in the years to come.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The major averages added to the strong gains posted last week.The major averages ended the day firmly in positive territory but off their highs of the session. The Dow jumped 212.90 points or 0.9 percent to 24,573.04, the Nasdaq climbed 49.63 points or 0.7 percent to 7,156.28 and the S&P 500 advanced 21.54 points or 0.8 percent to 2,677.84.The strength on Wall Street partly reflected a positive reaction to earnings news from financial giant Bank of America ( BAC ), which reported first quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates on strong loan growth.Positive sentiment was also generated by a report from the Commerce Department showing stronger than expected retail sales growth in the month of March.The report said retail sales climbed by 0.6 percent in March after edging down by 0.1 percent in February. Economists had expected retail sales to rise by 0.4 percent.Excluding a rebound in auto sales, retail sales edged up by 0.2 percent in March, matching the uptick seen in the previous month as well as economist estimates.""Overall, consumer spending has been disappointing in 1Q18, which is partially weather-related, but today's report suggests the slowdown was transitory,"" said James Knightley, Chief International Economist at ING.""We remain upbeat for the coming months,"" he added. ""Consumer confidence is high, supported by strong employment gains, rising wages and tax cuts. As such we look for a more positive contribution from consumer spending to overall GDP growth in 2Q18.""Meanwhile, traders have largely shrugged off a separate report from the National Association of Home Builders unexpectedly showing a modest drop in homebuilder confidence in the month of April.The report said the NAHB/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index edged down to 69 in April from 70 in March. Economists had expected the index to come in unchanged.Stocks remained positive in afternoon trading as traders digested news that President Donald Trump intends to nominate Richard Clarida as Federal Reserve Vice Chairman.Clarida is currently an economics professor at Columbia University and also serves as Global Strategic Advisor for PIMCO.Trump also intends to nominate Kansas State Bank Commissioner Michelle Bowman as a member of the Fed's Board of Governors.Sector NewsTransportation stocks showed a substantial move to the upside on the day, driving the Dow Jones Transportation Average up by 2.3 percent. With the jump, the average reached its best closing level in almost a month.Trucking company J.B. Hunt Transport Services (JBHT) led the transportation sector higher after reporting first quarter earnings growth on better than expected revenues.Significant strength was also visible among tobacco stocks, as reflected by the 1.7 percent gain posted by the NYSE Arca Tobacco Index. The index ended the session at a record closing high.Chemical, utilities, brokerage, and telecom stocks also saw considerable strength, moving higher along with most of the other major sectors.Other MarketsIn overseas trading, stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region turned in a mixed performance during trading on Monday. Japan's Nikkei 225 Index rose by 0.3 percent, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index tumbled by 1.6 percent.Meanwhile, the major European markets all moved to the downside on the day. While the French CAC 40 Index closed just below the unchanged line, the German DAX Index fell by 0.4 percent and the U.K.'s FTSE 100 Index slumped by 0.9 percent.In the bond market, treasuries recovered after seeing initial weakness before closing roughly flat for the second consecutive session.

Bank of America

are up more than 2.5% in intraday trading on Tuesday following
Warren Buffett's positive comments about the bank's CEO, Brian
Moynihan, coupled with another analyst upgrade.The question of whether to allow Moynihan to continue
occupying the chairman and CEO roles is the
biggest issue

facing Bank of America right now. The roles were combined until
shareholders voted in 2009 to separate them following the
bank's near-death experience the previous year.The problem is that Bank of America's board recombined the
roles in 2014 without shareholder approval. ""There's more work
ahead, but Brian's strategy to simplify the company and connect
it with the real economy continues to build value for
shareholders,"" former chairman Chad Holliday
said

at the time. ""The board strongly supports the strategy that
Brian has set and, after careful deliberation, has decided to
take these next steps in our governance responsibilities.""Shareholders weren't pleased. Multiple institutional
investors as well as shareholder advisory firms have since
opposed the move and are urging shareholders to re-separate the
roles in a Sept. 22 vote on the issue. Importantly, aside from
high-profile bank analyst Mike Mayo, most of the criticism has
been leveled against Bank of America's board, not Moynihan, who
most people agree has done a
commendable job

leading the nation's second biggest bank through the darkest
five years in its history.The good news for Moynihan is that he has Warren Buffett in
his corner. ""If I could vote, I would vote as management
suggests, which is to have Brian take on the CEO and chairman
job,"" Buffett
told

CNBC on Tuesday. ""He's done a first-class job"" turning the bank
around, the Oracle of Omaha continued.Although Buffett's firm
Berkshire Hathaway

has a roughly
$12 billion position

in the bank, he doesn't have a formal say on the matter. This
is because his position consists of preferred stock and
warrants to purchase common stock. In order to vote, he would
need to own common stock outright. That aside, the mere fact
that Buffett is entering the fray speaks volumes. He's the
greatest bank investor living and he's long been considered a
sage when it comes to proper management and the maximization of
shareholder returns.For its part, Bank of America has couched the issue in terms
of flexibility:The board believes that having the same flexibility on
board leadership that 97% of the S&P 500 now have, while
still providing strong independent oversight, is in the best
interest of stockholders. No company has dug out of a deeper
hole since the financial crisis, turned back to health with
solid earnings, and has accumulated record levels of capital
and liquidity -- also to the benefit of our shareholders. The
board respectfully recognizes that stockholders hold varying
views on this matter, which is why the board committed to
putting it to a vote.It's impossible to predict if Bank of America's board will
prevail. One glimmer of hope is that the same group of
institutional investors and shareholder advisory firms lined up
against
JPMorgan Chase

's
Jamie Dimon

last year for the same reason, yet shareholders in that case
voted overwhelmingly in favor of maintaining the combined
roles.The second piece of good news that seems to be fueling Bank
of America's stock today is yet another analyst upgrade. Nomura
raised its rating on the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's
stock to a ""buy"" from a ""neutral"" and placed an $18 price tag
on its stock. This follows similar upgrades by
Morgan Stanley

, KBW, and Baird, among others.Generally speaking, now is a great time to buy bank stocks.
While valuations at many banks have recovered from the
financial crisis, low interest rates are still weighing on the
bank industry's profitability. Once this changes, there's every
reason to believe that valuations will head even higher on
account of the added income.The next billion-dollar iSecret

Image source: iStock/Thinkstock.Investors who have waited patiently for Bank of America's(NYSE: BAC) stock to finally move past the doldrums from the financial crisis now have a tangible reason to be optimistic.On Thursday, the yield on the 10-year Treasury note climbed to its highest level since a majority of people in the United Kingdom voted in June to separate from the European Union, unleashing uncertainty in global financial markets and sending shares of Bank of America and its peers plunging.10 Year Treasury Ratedata by YCharts.Why are higher yields on the 10-year Treasury note such good news?They're good news because banks generate revenue from lending money on a long-term basis. And the interest rates they charge on loans are tied to government bond yields. Thus, when yields on government debt climb, so should bank profits.In Bank of America's latest quarterly regulatory filing, it estimated that if long-term rates were to climb by 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, then it would earn $4.5 billion more in annual net interest income.That alone is good. But there's more.Namely, the reason long-term rates surged yesterday is because investors are concerned about inflation. According toThe Wall Street Journal :The rising yields are the latest sign investors are bracing for what could be a major shift across markets. In recent years, falling commodities, meager wage rises and insipid economic growth kept prices low and pushed investors into assets such as long-dated bonds and high-dividend-paying stocks, that typically do better during periods when inflation is muted.Now inflation is ticking up again, and these markets are coming under pressure.If higher inflation were to materialize, that would give the Federal Reserve a strong incentive to raise short-term interest rates as well. It's been on the verge of doing so all year, but the one thing that's stopped it is the fact that consumer prices aren't rising at the 2% annual rate targeted by the Fed.Higher short-term rates would further catalyze Bank of America's top line. To this end, if both short-term rates and long-term rates rise simultaneously by 100 basis points, then Bank of America projects that it'd earn $7.5 billion more in annual net interest income. To be clear, there's little reason to think they'd rise that much that fast, but even a small boost in rates would translate into higher revenue.Suffice it to say that would go a long way toward helping the nation's second-biggest bank by assets achieve its objective of raising its return on assets from 0.9% last quarter to above the 1% benchmark that investors expect from a bank its size.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity The world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology.

TokenFunder, a Toronto-based startup that helps other startups launch and manage ICOs, is the first company to win approval for an ICO by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC).While some ICOs have come under regulatory scrutiny lately, TokenFunder CEO Alan Wunsche believes that ICOs can be done right, with built-in safeguards to avoid fraud.Wunsche said in a press release issued to Bitcoin Magazine:""TokenFunder has been working with the Ontario Securities Commission's LaunchPad for the past year to define an innovative funding model for businesses. Our offering will give investors the comfort of knowing that they are purchasing a security that can stand up to the scrutiny of regulation.""The OSCdecisionallows TokenFunder Inc. to launch their ICO November 1, selling FNDR tokens to retail investors who can then launch their own ICOs on TokenFunder's platform which is being built on the Ethereum blockchain.TokenFunder was given ""relief"" for a year from current regulations covering investors. This includes an exemption from registering as an investor and an exemption from a limit to the amount that can be raised in one offering.Wunsche notes that many firms using ICOs to raise investment funding are not able to verify where the funds are coming from making it risky to raise money this way. He believes that there is a safe way to use ICOs and is offering the expertise to provide investor protection within a sound regulatory framework.Like many jurisdictions around the world, the Ontario government is looking for ways to regulate ICOs without stifling innovation and driving startups to other jurisdictions.To date, some startups are holding ICOs without regulatory approval saying that their tokens or coins are not securities.TokenFunder offers an ICO process that they claim will build trust in digital finance through the use of best practices, including smart contracts to build in legal compliance and regulatory compliance to ensure that investor's rights are protected.TokenFunder offers token launch advisory services and is designed to operate within applicable securities laws and de-risk offerings and purchases of coins for both issuers and purchasers by providing, among other things, a regulatory approved platform and related support.TokenFunder co-founder Laura Pratt said in a press release:""A unique feature of our FNDR token is that it lets investors share in the future success of the platform. TokenFunder has innovative KYC and AML compliance safeguards, which investors don't receive with unregulated ICOs. After the completion of our ITO, our vision is to enable other companies to launch ITO's using our platform. It is a myth that regulation is in the way... it's the right way.""TokenFunder is a graduate of the OSC'sregulatory sandbox, part of the Canadian Securities Commission network of sandbox initiatives.LaunchPadis the Ontario sandbox with largely provincial jurisdiction but is also part of the federal securities experimental program. Its goal is to help new fintech startups work outside the current regulatory system and navigate a financial terrain that is largely based on traditional systems that may not work for new cryptocurrency and blockchain startups.The Blockchain Association of Canada ( BAC) has been lobbying the province's finance minister and others for more appropriate regulations for the new digital age.Executive Director Kyle Kemper, on behalf of the BAC told Bitcoin Magazine:""This is a first step in building a common understanding between all stakeholders around the potential, risks and opportunities of the token economy.""This ruling demonstrates that the OSC is adapting to a changing landscape and recognizes the need to support entrepreneurs leveraging blockchain technology. The Blockchain Association of Canada looks forward to assisting in developing a regulatory environment that supports continued innovation. The BAC congratulates the TokenFunder team for achieving this impressive milestone.""The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Bitcoin","BAC","[{'news_title': 'EOS Hype Builds as Over 50 Candidates Vie for 21 Supernodes', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/eos-hype-builds-as-over-50-candidates-vie-for-21-supernodes-cm952752', '_id': {'$oid': '5ae039363efc2c028c167b10'}}, {'news_title': 'The Genesis Files: How David Chaum’s eCash Spawned a Cypherpunk Dream', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/the-genesis-files-how-david-chaums-ecash-spawned-a-cypherpunk-dream-cm952648', '_id': {'$oid': '5ae039363efc2c028c167b11'}}, {'news_title': 'Invictus Blazes New Path to Crypto Investing', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/invictus-blazes-new-path-to-crypto-investing-cm952583', '_id': {'$oid': '5ae039363efc2c028c167b12'}}]","{'$date': '2017-10-25T18:00:32Z'}"

This happened after last week's selloff found support at the 200-day moving average. Amid the fastest bounce in eight years and capping the fifth consecutive rally, the bears will need to make a stand here if they are going to prevent a retest of the January high.Other markets weren't as sanguine with the U.S. dollar dropping and bonds trading heavily (despite a bounce in junk issues).In the end, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 1.2%, the S&P 500 gained 1.2%, the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.6%, and the Russell 2000 gained 0.9%. Treasury bonds were mixed overall, with the 10-year yield holding at 2.91%. Gold slipped, and crude oil moved higher.Bank stocks found support, with Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ) adding 0.7% to close in on its prior highs, as higher long-term interest rates raise hopes for higher net interest margins and thus, higher profits.7 'Strong Buy' Stocks That Look Cheap Right NowAdvancers outpaced decliners by a 2-to-1 ratio with 69 new highs vs. 48 new lows.The rally out of last week's lows has been technical in nature and led by big-cap tech and financial stocks. The former on pure momentum. The latter on margin hopes. As a result, the Nasdaq is up 5.6% just this week and is in the midst of its best rally since 2011.But the move feels extended now, with the CBOE Volatility Index remaining relatively buoyant given the short-squeeze action, interest rates continuing to drift higher and the inflation threat that bothered investors so badly two weeks ago still in play.This morning's Producer Price Index report showed core inflation, less food and energy, rising at just a 2.2% annual rate. Headline measures have been rising a bit faster; however, thanks to a rebound in energy prices, a weakening dollar (boosting import prices) and ongoing tightening in the labor markets.Another consequence of the weaker dollar is higher commodity prices, since the greenback is the most common dominator in global transactions. It's not coincidental that as the dollar weakened in recent months, crude oil has pushed from below $50 a barrel to hit a high of more than $66 earlier this month.The Best Days of FANG Stocks Seem To Be Behind ThemCaught in the whirlwind of broad market selling in recent weeks, prices are on the mend Thursday, pushing back over the $60-a-barrel threshold. On a year-over-year basis, prices are up about 11%, with comparisons growing easier as we lap the energy price swoon seen last summer.Watch for energy inflation to thus creep higher as we approach the peak summer driving season.

(is) driven by what is available and how much it costs.""The rule proposes that brokers ""act in the best interest of that customer at the time the recommendation is made, without placing the financial or other interest of the (firm) ahead of the interest of the retail customer.""Commissioner Kara Stein was critical of the proposed rule and voted that it not be opened up for the 90-day public comment period because, she said, it does not set hard lines defining what is in a client's best interest and will add to confusion.The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which also governs brokerages, already requires the 3,800 firms follow a best interest standard, which could lead to different interpretations by it and the SEC, she said.""I am concerned that this rule will not only confuse retail investors, but also brokerages,"" Stein said.The rule includes a provision barring brokers from calling themselves investment advisors or advisers, a formal title that comes with additional disclosure and registration requirements and which brokers sometimes use casually.Stein said that if the SEC was going to say who can be called an advisor or adviser, then it should be ""logically consistent"" and define the best interest standard.The SEC did not provide an estimate of what it would cost firms to comply with the rule.","Stocks,Technology","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Facebook (FB) 1st Quarter Earnings: What to Expect', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/facebook-fb-1st-quarter-earnings-what-to-expect-cm952854', '_id': {'$oid': '5ae06f363efc2c028c17a59b'}}, {'news_title': '2 Areas Where Intel Needs to Boost Investments', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/2-areas-where-intel-needs-to-boost-investments-cm952838', '_id': {'$oid': '5ae06f363efc2c028c17a59c'}}, {'news_title': '7 Small Gestures You Can Make as a Manager That Will Go a Long Way', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/7-small-gestures-you-can-make-as-a-manager-that-will-go-a-long-way-cm952840', '_id': {'$oid': '5ae06f363efc2c028c17a59d'}}]","{'$date': '2018-04-18T17:40:00Z'}"

A second round is also required if Petrobras, after chosing to negotiate just with one bidder, agrees to any change in the acquisition contract that involves a financial impact.Petrobras asked the bids to value TAG based on last December's financial statements, but with a provision to adjust bids by an interest rate equivalent to Brazil's interbank rate plus 3 percent until the date of the closing.All of the bids were highly leveraged, according to sources.The Macquarie group includes the Canada Private Pension Investment Board, known as CPPIB, sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte and Brazilian holding companies Itaúsa Investimentos SAand Cambuhy Investimentos SA.Bank of America Corpand Banco Bradesco SAare advising the Macquarie group on the financing, and it was expected to back its bid with around 60 percent in debt, according to sources with knowledge of the matter.Mubadala and EIG Global Energy Partners formed a group that was joined by Italy'sSnam SpAas a shareholder and the gas pipeline operator.

""This is the mathematical calculation that shows there are robust levels of capital for most firms. Next week will be the judgment.""The Fed introduced the stress tests during the financial crisis to ensure the strength of the banking industry, whose ability to lend is considered crucial to the health of the economy.Since the first test in 2009, banks have seen losses abate, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The banks that now undergo the exam have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $800 billion in top-notch capital, the Fed said.U.S. subsidiaries of six foreign lenders, including Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AGand UBS Group AG, also go through the test and had their results publicly released for the first time.Deutsche Bank, whose U.S. operations have been under intense regulatory scrutiny, also easily met all the minimum capital requirements, as did Credit Suisse and UBS, the results showed.Other banks tested include household names like JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Bank of America Corpand Wells Fargo & Co, as well as major regional lenders like Capital One Financial Corp, PNC Financial Services Group Incand U.S. Bancorpand Wall Street banks Goldman Sachs Group Incand Morgan Stanley.Banks investors view the test as a hurdle for capital returns through stock buybacks and dividends. It could also boost the case for regulatory relief promised by the Trump administration.The Fed increases the difficulty of the test as the broader economic environment improves. This year the test features a severe global recession with the U.S. unemployment rate rising by almost 6 percentage points to 10 percent, accompanied by a steepening Treasury yield curve.Some banks' results were hurt this time by the new federal tax law, which changed the impact of past losses on hypothetical tax bills under the scenarios, senior Fed officials said.The second portion of the test will be released on Wednesday. Those results will determine whether the Fed approves or denies capital plans. Banks now have an opportunity to resubmit those plans if they find their own projections were much sunnier than the Fed's.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,Economy,401k,BankingandLoans,Retirement","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Validea Motley Fool Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 6/27/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-motley-fool-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-6272018-cm983797', '_id': {'$oid': '5b334ef03efc2c4c0476cb37'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Kenneth Fisher Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 6/27/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-kenneth-fisher-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-6272018-cm983796', '_id': {'$oid': '5b334ef03efc2c4c0476cb38'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea John Neff Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 6/27/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-john-neff-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-6272018-cm983795', '_id': {'$oid': '5b334ef03efc2c4c0476cb39'}}]","{'$date': '2018-06-21T16:30:00Z'}"

GE's stock slipped 1.5 percent in after-hours trading following the announcement while Walgreens jumped 3 percent.It now ranks as the sixth smallest member of the Dow by market value and carries the index's lowest stock price, making it the least influential component of the price-weighted average.Faced with weak profits and calls to be broken up, the 126-year-old company is aggressively cutting costs, selling businesses and trying to strengthen its balance sheet under new managers and a new board.Its stock has fallen nearly 80 percent from highs in 2000. Last month, Chief Executive John Flannery warned that GE may not be able to pay its 2019 dividend.""It was at one time perhaps one of the quintessential U.S. companies, and like others that have been taken out of the Dow, it's a reflection that they're no longer seen in that light,"" said Rick Meckler, a partner at Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey.WALGREENS HELPS REFLECT U.S. ECONOMYThe shifting sands of the Dow are testament to the various companies that were unassailable household names for decades before becoming the victims of an evolving economy. Some simply disappeared, while others found new life even if they did not reclaim their prior economic influence. They include Eastman Kodak, Sears Roebuck, International Paper, Goodyear, Bethlehem Steel, Westinghouse, General Motors Coand Chrysler.Co-founded by inventor Thomas Edison, GE was the largest U.S. company by stock market value starting in 1993, with brief interruptions from Microsoft Incuntil Exxon Mobil Corpovertook it in 2005.With the addition of Walgreens, the Dow will better reflect the role of consumers and healthcare in the U.S. economy, S&P Dow Jones Indices said in a statement.While analysts had anticipated GE's exit from the Dow because of its falling share price, it is a blow to the company to lose its status as the only original member of the iconic index. GE did leave the Dow after the index was founded in 1896 but rejoined in 1907 and has been a constant member since then, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.In a statement, GE said: ""We are focused on executing against the plan we've laid out to improve GE's performance. Today's announcement does nothing to change those commitments or our focus in creating in a stronger, simpler GE.""Some index watchers had expected GE's troubles to lead to its removal from the elite index.Not all companies that have lost their place in the Dow have gone to their graves. Bank of America Corphas outperformed the Dow by 46 percentage points since it was removed in 2013.GE had fallen on hard times even as former Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt sought to jettison ailing businesses and focus on the company's industrial roots in power plants, jet engines, locomotives and other large equipment. Its industrial software business did not perform as expected, forcing GE to scale in its ambitions last year.Immelt also built up GE's exposure to manufacturing and servicing coal and gas-fired electricity plants, only to see demand for such plants fall dramatically in recent years as sales of suddenly cost-competitive renewable wind and solar systems increased.Aiming to generate cash and restore profitability, CEO John Flannery, who took over from Immelt last August, is exiting $20 billion in additional GE assets, including the locomotive business and a unit that makes small power-plant engines.Changes to the Dow are made on an as-needed basis and selection is not governed by quantitative rules, according to published methodology for the index.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,Politics,Oil","BAC","[{'news_title': 'European Equity Benchmarks Close Lower; EU Unemployment Rate at Lowest Level in Eight Years', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/european-equity-benchmarks-close-lower-eu-unemployment-rate-at-lowest-level-in-eight-years-cm986341', '_id': {'$oid': '5b3a60903efc2c6707003db9'}}, {'news_title': 'Mid-Day Update: U.S. Stocks Narrow Losses, Trade War Concerns Continue to Dampen Sentiment', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/mid-day-update-us-stocks-narrow-losses-trade-war-concerns-continue-to-dampen-sentiment-cm986317', '_id': {'$oid': '5b3a60903efc2c6707003dba'}}, {'news_title': 'Middle East Shares Mostly Dip As Oil Declines on Production Comments', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/middle-east-shares-mostly-dip-as-oil-declines-on-production-comments-cm986319', '_id': {'$oid': '5b3a60903efc2c6707003dbb'}}]","{'$date': '2018-06-19T18:12:00Z'}"

It said Merrill falsely told customers that more than 15.8 million orders worth over $141 billion had occurred in-house.Bank of America referred to a statement in made on March 23 about the New York settlement, when it said: ""At all times we met our obligation to deliver the best prices to clients.

Not only would a higher rating reflect the bank's progress over the past eight years, but it would also lower its cost of funds and thereby boost its earnings.While there are three major ratings agencies, you only need to look at one of them to get a sense for Bank of America's opportunity for improvement. To this end, Moody'sgives Bank of America's long-term debt a rating of Baa1. That rates the $2.2 trillion bank below many of its staunchest competitors.BankLong-Term Senior Debt Ratings from Moody'sU.S. BancorpA1Wells FargoA2BB&TA2JPMorgan ChaseA3PNC FinancialA3Bank of AmericaBaa1Data source: U.S. Bancorp.A bank's debt ratings matter because they dictate the interest rate at which a bank can borrow money, with a higher rating translating into a lower cost of funds.Last year, for example, Bank of America borrowed nearly $230 billion on a long-term basis at an average annual rate of 2.44%. Wells Fargo, which has a higher debt rating, had roughly the same amount of long-term debt as Bank of America did, but its interest rate was only 1.6%. Translated into dollars and cents, this means that Wells Fargo spends $2 billionless a year to borrow the same amount of money as Bank of America does.The good news is that the North Carolina-based bank is headed in the right direction. At the end of January, Moody's changed its outlook on Bank of America from stable to positive, citing its improved profitability in particular:The change in outlook to positive from stable is based on Moody's view that there is an increased likelihood that Bank of America's profitability will strengthen on a sustainable basis over the next twelve to eighteen months, while the bank continues to adhere to its conservative risk profile, lowering its earnings volatility. If achieved, this would strengthen the bank's credit profile and could lead to a ratings upgrade.Moody's went on to cite Bank of America's goal to reduce expenses by an additional $3 billionby the end of 2018, as well as the benefit that rising rates will have on its top line. ""A realization of the bank's latest cost targets, combined with an increase in net interest income from higher interest rates, if achieved and sustained, should improve the bank's operating leverage and raise its profitability on a sustainable basis, strengthening the bank's credit profile,"" the ratings agency said in a recent assessmentof Bank of America.This assessment tracks Moody's ratings methodologyfor banks, which is dictated by macroeconomic factors, a bank's unique financial profile, and qualitative adjustments. Within a bank's financial profile, moreover, Moody's balances five factors based on specific weightings: asset risk (25%), capital (25%), profitability (15%), funding structure (20%), and liquid resources (15%).Data source: Moody's. Chart by author.Given that Bank of America holds an abundance of excess capital and liquidity, as I've discussed in the past, it makes sense that Moody's (and presumably the other ratings agencies) has zeroed in on the bank's profitability as the main hurdle between it and higher ratings.This is an auspicious sign for Bank of America given that its profitability is improving, becoming more predictable, and should continue to grow in the years ahead. It earned more money last year, for instance, than in any other year in its history, with the exception of 2006.The result for current and prospective investors in Bank of America is that its continued recovery will not only impact the bank's bottom line directly, through higher revenues and lower expenses, but also indirectly, as higher debt ratings in the future should eventually reflect this improvement and thereby translate into lower borrowing costs.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

B of A has done an excellent job of recovering from its near-disaster, but even after seeing its shares jump nearly 30% so far in 2017, the bank still has a long way to go before its stock will get back to where it traded in the mid-2000s. It took an especially hard hit during the financial crisis in 2008, and has taken longer than some of its big-bank rivals to rebound fully from the crushing blow the stock suffered after the end of the housing boom in the mid-2000s.Dividends are an area in which it has taken Bank of America even longer to recover. Yet with B of A having delivered a huge dividend increase earlier this year, investors are increasingly optimistic that future hikes are not only likely but inevitable. Below, we'll take a closer look at whether Bank of America will raise its dividend in 2017.Current Quarterly Dividend Per Share$0.12Current Yield1.7%Number of Consecutive Years With Dividend Increases4 yearsPayout Ratio20%Last IncreaseAugust 2017Data source: Yahoo! Finance. Last increase refers to ex-dividend date.Many younger investors will be surprised to learn that Bank of America spent much of its history accumulating a sterling reputation as a dividend giant. The company became a Dividend Aristocrat in the early 2000s, maintaining that status until the onset of the pressures on the banking industry that eventually led to the financial crisis. B of A not only kept its dividend growing but also did so at a healthy clip, and the bank stock's dividend yield was often in the 4% to 5% range, making it fairly generous even among dividend-friendly financials.The housing bust put an end to that dividend growth, and the bank quickly concluded that it needed to take steps to save as much of its free cash as possible. An early 50% dividend cut reflected hopes that B of A would be able to emerge from the crisis without more dramatic action, but the losses that stemmed from the snowballing crisis proved too large to support even that lower dividend.BAC Dividenddata by YCharts.By the end of the crisis, Bank of America had cut its dividend to a token $0.01 per share, and it took years for the bank to get authorization to restore its quarterly payouts. The Fed denied a request from B of A to boost its dividend in 2011, and it took another three years before the bank was able to deliver a sizable increase to $0.05 per share. Since then, two subsequent boosts of 50% in 2016 and 60% in 2017 have helped make the bank's dividend more respectable. But it's still less than a fifth of what the payout was prior to the crisis, and the current yield of 1.6% is a disappointment to income investors.Image source: Bank of America.What should be more worrying to investors is that Bank of America has signaled that restoring its dividend to its former glory isn't a top priority. CEO Brian Moynihan said after the most recent payout increasethat the bank wanted to be cautious about the extent to which it increases its dividends so as to avoid the likelihood of ever subsequently having to cut them again. To keep regulators happy, Moynihan wants to keep Bank of America's payout ratio well below the perceived target of 30% of earnings.That doesn't mean that B of A won't make a dividend increase in 2018, but expecting another 50% to 60% rise would require more earnings growth than is likely. A reasonable middle ground would be a 25% boost to $0.15 per share, which would put the dividend yield back above 2% while still keeping payout ratios around the 25% level. That level of boost to the dividend, along with more rounds of stock buybacks, could be the most likely outcome for Bank of America in 2018.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

For the three months ending March 31, Bank of America earned $4.3 billion, 44% more than the year-ago period.""Our approach to responsible growth delivered strong results again this quarter,"" said Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan in prepared remarks. ""The U.S. economy continues to show consumer and business optimism, and our results reflect that.""Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America.Bank of America's earnings growth was powered by a $1.5 billion increase in its top line. The biggest contribution was from trading revenue, which came in at $3.9 billion, a 23% increase over the first quarter of 2016. The North Carolina-based bank wasn't alone in this regard, as JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup also reported double-digit increases in their quarterly trading revenue for the first three months of the year.These performances were less about the first quarter of this year and more about the beginning of last year. Turmoil in the capital markets at the time caused institutional investors to stay on the sidelines, depriving Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citigroup of the revenue they'd otherwise earn making markets in fixed-income and equity securities.Higher interest rates also contributed to Bank of America's top-line growth. The bank estimated last year that a 25-basis-point increase in the fed funds rate would translate into an added $600 million worth of quarterly net interest income. That's almost exactly what we saw. The Federal Reserve raised rates in December, leading to $573 million worth of additional net interest income for Bank of America.Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author.And things should only improve from here. Bank of America is one of the most asset-sensitive banks in its peer group, meaning that higher rates will have a more potent impact on its revenue than other banks. On top of this, the Fed raised rates again in March, which should further boost Bank of America's net interest income in the quarters ahead.Bank of America benefited as well from lower loan loss provisions -- money set aside in anticipation of future loan losses. In the first quarter of last year, banks ratcheted up their provisions, as cratering energy prices were causing an uptick in defaults among oil and gas companies. This is less of a concern because oil prices have since doubled, enabling Bank of America to reduce its first-quarter provision expense by $162 million.The one aspect of Bank of America's earnings that went against expectations was a slight increase in operating expenses. This was mostly due to higher compensation expenses. This is a surprise given that Bank of America committed last year to reducing annual expenses by an additional $3 billion by the end of 2018. This is obviously only one quarter out of a dozen, but the trend is certainly in the wrong direction.Expenses aside, there was a lot to like in Bank of America's first-quarter performance. Most importantly, its return on tangible common equity came in at 10.3%. That's less than the bank's 12% target , but it nevertheless represents a meaningful improvement from 7.3% a year ago.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America

In fact, Bank of America is poised to profit more than most from higher interest rates, due to a greater percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits.If Trump gets mired in a political scandal, losing the faith of his fellow Republicans in Congress and potentially facing a long, drawn-out investigation, it seems less likely that Trump will be able to follow through with his ambitious agenda -- at least in the kind of time frame investors had been expecting.Today's move was purely due to the political drama in Washington. If things quiet down and the Comey-related headlines go away, the banking sector could easily recover. On the other hand, if the recent news turns into a long investigation, or even impeachment proceedings, there could be a lot more downside for Bank of America and other financial stocks.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

And over the past 12 months, Bank of America's shares have climbed 66%, compared to an average on the two indexes of 28% since this time last year.The optimism toward shares of Bank of America and other bank stocks over the past year was well-founded, as then-candidate Donald Trump vowed on the campaign trail last year that he would ""dismantle"" the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, and push Congress to lower taxes. The former would reduce compliance costs at banks, which have soared since the legislation was passed, while the latter would act as a direct stimulant on bank profitability.But given Bank of America's performance over the past year, you'd be excused for thinking that there isn't much juice left to squeeze out of its stock in the foreseeable future. Still, if one looks at the bank's valuation, there seems to be room for further growth:BACdata by YCharts.As a case in point, take Bank of America's price-to-book-value ratio. This is one of the most common ways to value bank stocks. It compares a bank's book value per share to its share price, dividing the latter by the former.Bank of America's price-to-book-value ratio is currently 1.1, according to YCharts.com; this means that it trades for approximately 10% above its book value per share. Don't let this premium fool you, however, because the average bank stock on the two indexes cited above trades for 1.5 times book value, or at a 50% premium to book.The same is true if you look at the other principal valuation metric used by investors in banking stocks: the price-to-earnings ratio. This ratio communicates how much it costs to buy $1 of a particular company's earnings, and is calculated by dividing a bank's share price by its earnings per share.Bank of America's price-to-earnings ratio is 15.7, using its earnings over the trailing 12 months; this means it costs $15.70 to buy each dollar of the bank's annual earnings. That might seem pricey, but it compares to an average price-to-earnings ratio of 18.4 on the two KBW bank indexes.In short, even if Bank of America's shares are near their 52-week high, that doesn't mean its stock can't continue to climb from here, as it continues to trade at a lower valuation than many of its peers.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Shares of the nation's second-biggest bank by assets fell 3.2% on Tuesday.That exceeded the 2.3% drop of the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap bank stocks. It's also bigger than the 0.8% drop on the S&P 500.Company/IndexPerformance on Sept. 5, 2017S&P 500KBW Bank IndexBank of AmericaData source: Yahoo! Finance.There wasn't any fundamental news that broke on Tuesday that caused Bank of America's stock to suffer more than the broader market. It was instead a combination of two factors.The first was the catalyst for the decline in stocks largely across the board: North Korea's purported test over the weekend of a hydrogen bomb.""After North Korea's test of its most powerful nuclear bomb yet, investors headed for safer stores of value, like U.S. government bonds and gold,"" wrote The Wall Street Journal.This is systematic riskthat impacted stocks broadly, thereby explaining the drop in Bank of America's stock.But what explains the extent of Bank of America's drop is related to its betaof 1.61. This is a measure of how much a specific stock moves in relation to the market on an average day.Beta is the market's version of turbulent. Image source: Getty Images.A stock with a beta of 1.0 mirrors the market on the average day. If the market goes up 2%, so does a stock with a beta of 1.0.In Bank of America's case, its 1.61 beta means that its stock will move by an average of 61% more than the broader market on a given day. If the market is up 1%, for instance, Bank of America's will be up 1.61%.The net result is that the drop in Bank of America's stock price on Tuesday, though steep, need not be a cause of concern to the bank's shareholders. Both its direction and its magnitude were caused by external forces that aren't reflective of its ongoing progress toward its performance targets.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Not only have large banks grown accustomed to the exercise over the past few years, but banks have far more capital nowadays than is needed to pass the tests.Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) offers a case in point.Image source: The Motley Fool.The purpose of stress tests is straight forward. They're to ""help make sure that banks will be able to lend to households and businesses even in a serious recession by ensuring that they have adequate capital to absorb losses they may sustain,"" the Federal Reserve explains.The key is capital. If a bank has enough capital to survive an economic downturn akin to the financial crisisand continue lending to consumers and businesses, then it will pass the test. If it doesn't, then it will fail.The assumptions in this year's test are severe, but they essentially track last year's test. Among other things, the Fed assumes that the unemployment rate spikes to 10%, gross domestic product falls 6.5%, stock prices lose half their value, home prices drop by 25%, and commercial real estate prices fall 35%.To determine how a bank's capital will weather this storm, the variable to watch is the common equity tier 1 capital ratio, or CET1 ratio. This compares how much highly liquid capital a bank has relative to a risk-weighted measure of assets.The details underlying these calculations are complicated, but all an investor needs to know is that a bank must maintain a CET1 ratio of at least 4.5% to pass the first round of the stress tests, known as DFAST, the results of which are due out on Thursday.Going into this year's test, Bank of America's CET1 ratio was 12%, which marks an improvement over last year, when it entered the test with a 11.6% CET1 ratio. I won't belabor you with the math, but this means that Bank of America has $104 billion more capital than prescribed by the 4.5% regulatory minimum.Bank of America Capital MetricAmountCET1 Capital$167.4 billionCushion over regulatory minimum$104.4 billionEstimated loss in 2016 DFAST$36.3 billionExcess CET1 capital over regulatory minimum and estimated loss in 2016 DFAST$68.1 billionSource: Bank of America, author's calculations.This gives Bank of America a lot of wiggle room. And it's much more than the bank was projected to lose in last year's test, when the Fed estimated that the North Carolina-based bank's net loss over the nine-quarter horizon would add up to $36.3 billion.Assuming Bank of America experiences a similar loss in this year's test, it would still have $68 billion in common equity tier 1 capital above the 4.5% benchmark that's needed to pass the test. Absent a completely unforeseen event, that's more than enough to allow shareholders in the nation's second biggest bank by assets to safely assume that it will sail through the Fed's gauntlet this year.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The regulator's newfound veto power over bank capital plans came as part of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which significantly scaled up banks' compliance burdens.The U.S. Federal Reserve Building at sunset. Image source: Getty Images.The Fed could reject a bank for one of two reasons. First, on quantitative grounds, if the bank wasn't projected to have enough capital to remain well-capitalized through the most extreme version of the annual stress test. And second, on qualitative grounds, if the Fed concluded that a bank didn't have an adequately sophisticated capital planning process in place.Few banks have problems with the quantitative aspect, as they can forecast relatively accurately the impact on their capital given the underlying stress test assumptions. It's the qualitative grounds that banks take issue with, as they're fuzzier and more subjective.Wells Fargo's new CEO Tim Sloan made this pointat an industry conference last year:When you step back and think, should large financial institutions be stressing their balance sheet and their business model before they decide how much capital to pay out to shareholders? Of course, they should. I mean, it makes all the sense in the world. But we've moved from an objective standard to now maybe subjective [standards] are more important than objective. That would be something that you look at.Bank of America's Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihanechoed these remarks at the same conference:For us as a company, just because of where we are, it's about capital return. ... It's about getting certainly around the ability to have access to your capital return once you've met all the hurdles. And whether those hurdles move up or down because of various peoples' points of view, the issue is the industry's above them, and now we need to be able to get the capital out.The good news for banks, in turn, is that this aspect of the test could soon go away. Former Fed governor Tarullo made this point on his way out the door earlier this year, suggesting that it may be time to end the qualitative part of the annual stress test.And it seems safe to say that the people most likely to be selected by President Trump to fill the three open seats on the Fed's governing committee will agree, given his vow on the campaign trail to reduce regulations on banks and other financial service providers.Of all the banks that would benefit from this change, few would welcome it as much as Bank of America. Its efforts to meaningfully increase the amount of capital it returns to shareholders have been throttled since the crisis in large part because of the qualitative portion of the stress tests.Bank of America has increased its dividend only twice since the financial crisis, compared to annual raises at JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo. Image source: YCharts.com.If that were to go away, it would enable the North Carolina-based bank to purge its balance sheet of an enormous surplus of pent-up capital, easily translating into a total payout ratio in excess of 100% beginning as early as next year.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

You can see this in a chart of Bank of America's quarterly earnings per share.BAC EPS Diluted (Quarterly)data by YCharts.As you can see, the volatility in Bank of America's earnings per share has declined dramatically over the past two years.From 2008 to 2012, the bank faced one multibillion-dollar legal settlement after another. The biggest was a $16.65 billion deal with multiple state and federal agencies over the sale of shoddy residential mortgage-backed securities -- principally by Countrywide Financial -- in the lead-up to the financial crisis.Costs like these caused Bank of America's earnings per share to swing violently from large losses in one quarter to mediocre earnings in another. This hurts a bank in a number of ways, beyond just giving shareholders heartburn:It weighs on a bank's valuation, as investors reward certainty.It hurts a bank's credit rating, which reflects the financial strength of an organization and impacts a bank's cost of funds.The consistency of earnings is weighed by regulators each year to determine whether to approve a bank's capital return requests as a part of the annual stress test.Fortunately, Bank of America's earnings should continue only to get better from here.The Bank of America Corporate Center in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: Getty Images.Its first-quarter performanceoffers a case in point. Earnings grew 44% through the first three months of the year at the North Carolina-based bank. They were fueled by higher interest rates, which boosted Bank of America's quarterly net interest income by nearly $600 million compared to the year-ago period, as well as higher trading revenues in its investment bank.The landscape ahead looks even more promising. The Federal Reserve's decision to hike the fed funds ratein March, which marked the second time it had done so in four months, will boost Bank of America's net interest income by $150 milliona quarter on a go-ahead basis. And if the central bank follows through on its projected pathof interest rates, there could be two more increases in 2017 alone, both of which would bolster Bank of America's profits.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

But there are signs that Main Street depositors are getting restless too, after the Federal Reserve lifted its interest rate target for the seventh time in less than three years.Wealthy customers reduced deposits by between 4 and 12 percent at the wealth management units of three of the biggest banks by assets, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corpand Wells Fargo & Co, compared with a year earlier, the banks said.Citigroup Inc, the third-largest bank by assets, said that more affluent clients were behind a 3 percent decline in deposits in its retail bank in North America.The banks said that while the shift in deposit costs on smaller accounts is less noticeable, they are factoring higher deposit costs into their models for future earnings.Deposits are the raw inventory of bank profits and provide some of the cheapest and most reliable funds. While deposit costs have started rising, the gap between what banks pay for deposits and what they generate from making loans remains wide.JPMorgan, for instance, was paying more than twice as much on interest-bearing deposits in the second quarter as it did a year earlier, at 0.51 percent compared with 0.25 percent. Its loans generated 4.99 percent in the second quarter.Overall, since the Fed began boosting rates in December 2015, banks have been able to avoid passing along even one-third of the total 1.75 percentage-point increase to depositors, according to analysts at Bernstein.Some bankers are not too worried about retail deposits fleeing or costing substantially more. Bank of America's checking and savings customers are not pushing for higher rates, with the average balance rising to $7,500 from $7,000 a year earlier, executives said.But others are bracing for further pricing pressure as the Fed is expected to boost rates again in September.""You are going to start to see the U.S. retail customer, not just for Citi, but for the industry, begin to clamor for higher rates,"" said Citigroup Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,401k,BankingandLoans,Politics,Retirement","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Netflix Takes a Breather From Its Torrid Growth', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/netflix-takes-a-breather-from-its-torrid-growth-cm994334', '_id': {'$oid': '5b5229b63efc2c0c05206fe1'}}, {'news_title': 'Best Prime Day Ever: Amazon Members Bought Over 100 Million Items', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/best-prime-day-ever-amazon-members-bought-over-100-million-items-cm994338', '_id': {'$oid': '5b5229b63efc2c0c05206fe2'}}, {'news_title': 'Better Buy: Verizon Communications Inc. vs. Altria Group', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/better-buy-verizon-communications-inc-vs-altria-group-cm994342', '_id': {'$oid': '5b5229b63efc2c0c05206fe3'}}]","{'$date': '2018-07-16T17:51:00Z'}"

Here are the details of Buffett's Bank of America investment, and what he had to say about his company's investment.Image source: The Motley Fool.In August 2011, Buffett decided to purchase $5 billion in Bank of America preferred stock, which paid an annual dividend yield of 6%. However, the sweetest part of the deal turned out to be a warrant to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America's common stock for $7.14 each until September 2021.Now, this didn't seem like a tremendous deal at the time, since the warrant's exercise price was roughly identical to the bank's stock price in August 2011, giving the warrant no immediate intrinsic value. However, the bank's share price has more than tripled since then, making the warrant worth $11.8 billion as of this writing. In fact, if we include the value of the preferred stock and the dividends Berkshire has been paid so far, Buffett's original $5 billion investment is worth $18.3 billion today:BACstock-price data by YCharts.When asked whether Berkshire would exercise its B of A warrant, Buffett essentially said that wasn't even up for debate. Since the warrant allows Berkshire to buy Bank of America stock for less than one-third of its current share price, it would be silly not to exercise it. Not doing so would leave $11.8 billion on the table, based on the bank's current stock price.The real questions are:1. Whenwill Berkshire exercise its warrant?2. Will the bank hold on to its shares after the warrant is exercised?This is the easier of the two questions to answer, as Buffett addressed this specific issue in his latest letter to Berkshire's shareholders. The timing of the warrant exercise depends on what happens with Bank of America's dividend over the next few years.Since Berkshire's Bank of America preferred stock pays $300 million per year, and Buffett has mentioned that Berkshire could (and likely will) use its preferred shares to pay the cost of exercising the warrant, Bank of America's dividend would need to replace that lost income to justify an early exercise.Doing the math: In order for 700 million shares of Bank of America to generate over $300 million in income, the bank would need to raise its dividend to $0.44 per share. Currently, the bank pays just $0.30 per share. So, if the dividend is raised to $0.44 or higher, Berkshire would likely exercise its warrant well before expiration.On the other hand, if the bank's dividend remains below this threshold, Buffett would exercise the warrant just before it expires.With the annual review of Bank of America's capital plan due in a couple of months, keep in mind that a $0.44 dividend is the magic number that could determine whether Berkshire will buy Bank of America stock in 2017.This is the tougher question, simply because we don't know when the warrant will be exercised. And if a significant amount of time passes before it happens, there's simply no telling what could happen to Bank of America, or the banking business as a whole, between now and then.At Berkshire's meeting, Buffett did say ""we would keep the stock"" ifthe warrant were to expire, or get exercised today. Buffett commented in his letter that he's a fan of Bank of America's aggressive share repurchases while the stock is undervalued. It's fair to assume that if he still perceives Bank of America to be fairly valued at the time of the warrant's exercise, it could become the newest addition to the bank stocks already in Berkshire's portfolio.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Thank you and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Good morning. This was another strong quarter and year for our company across the board.We drove positive operating leverage consistently through the year. In fact, this is the 12th straight quarter where we have reported a positive operating leverage on a year-over-year basis. You can see that on Slide 3. And we did it the right way.We achieved it through fundamental operating excellence, driving revenue, and controlling expenses, combined with strong relationship in sales and production. Full-year revenue was up 5%, excluding the tax act impact, while expenses declined 1%. Our business generated 6% loan growth for the year. We grew and remained true to our responsible growth operating model where there's a clear recognition throughout the company of who our targeted customers are and how we manage risk and our desired outcomes.So, let me highlight a little our progress.For the year we reported $18 billion in after-tax net income. Excluding the tax act impact of $2.9 billion, we would have reported net income of $21 billion which is up 18% over [Inaudible] 2016. This represents the highest earnings run rate for the company in its history. Paul will discuss the tax act impact in a little more detail later.Our company remains balanced, with earnings coming relatively evenly from our consumer and our commercial institutional segment businesses. On a more businesses for people, our consumer businesses and our wealth-management businesses, together they earned more than $11 billion and grew 14% while our global banking and global markets business together generated about $10 billion, and they're up 7%. Excluding the tax act impact, our return on tangible common equity was 11% and our return on assets was 93 basis points, pushing closer to our long-term target. Across the board in our businesses, our brand improved in every area recognized by many outside parties.And through our higher stock price and improved credit ratings, we saw tangible benefits of our progress. Shareholders not only saw share price improvement but we increased our dividend by 60% and reduced our fully diluted share count during the year by 3.4%. Average diluted shares were down 370 million from this time last year and down nearly 1 billion from the peak. With an approved CCAR plus our additional 5 billion, we'll continue to make progress in this area.At the core of our model is a talented group of teammates, our best assets.Therefore, we continue to invest heavily in making our company the best place for our teammates to work. Not only do we continue to rank high in overall list of best companies to work for, we rank in the top 50 list of the best workplaces for diversity, for parents, for working mothers, and Hispanics, among others. You can see some of these accolades in a couple of the appendix slides we've added to the package this time. This year we also invested heavily in our teammates' [Inaudible] improvements and starting minimum wages, where we put them at $15 this time last year.We introduced sabbaticals, family leave increases, bereavement leave policy extensions, and wellness initiatives. This latest example is our announcement at the year-end we were able to provide nearly 70% of our teammates with a bonus to share in our future success of the expected benefits of the tax savings. As Paul will explain, this added $145 million in expenses in the fourth quarter. We did all this while investing to continue to lower cost me so we can make more money in our franchise.We also lowered costs while we continued our investment in digital capabilities for security protection for our customers, which drove our online and mobile banking leadership rankings. We also rolled out digital shopping capabilities in auto and in home. We are also heavily investing in capabilities for our investment clients across the wealth-management spectrum through our award-winning digital brokerage capabilities as well as our treasury capabilities for our commercial clients. Our consumer mobile banking app became the first app in the Apple App Store to be certified by JD Power.We know there's much more to do to continue to drive this positive change in our company and for the benefit of our customers and clients. So we as a team are proud of the outcome today for sure, but even more proud that we're proving that we can win and do it the right way to drive responsible growth, and we plan to do that in the future.With that, let me turn over to Paul to give you comments on the quarter.Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThank you, Brian. I want to go back to Slide 2 to start. We reported net income up $2.4 billion, or $0.20 per diluted share, in Q4. Late in the quarter, we informed investors through our 8K filing that we expect an impact of approximately $3 billion from the tax act.Our estimated impact came in just shy of $2.9, lowering EPS by $0.27. Remember, the tax act is complex, with several novel provisions. Any clarifying guidance or new information could affect our estimated impact and, as noted in our materials, the impact was recorded in two places. First, in other income, there was a charge of approximately $950 million to revalue certain renewable-energy investments.With the new income tax line, this pre-tax charge was offset by the tax benefit of this $950 million charge plus the revalue of certain deferred-tax liabilities associated with these renewable-energy investments. In total, the tax line includes $1.9 billion aggregated expense, with a multiple impact of the tax act including the tax benefit of the charge for new energy investments that I just mentioned as well as the revaluation of our deferred-tax assets and deferred-tax liabilities. In our material, we provided a chart reflecting results on a basis that excludes the tax act impact. We believe this provides a more clear comparison to Q4 '16.On that basis, net income was $5.3 billion with EPS of $0.47 per share, growing 20% year over year. Return on tangible common equity was 11%. Return on assets was 90 basis points. Operating leverage year over year was a strong 8%.Revenue was $21 billion, improving 7%. An 11% improvement in net-interest income drove revenue growth. Expenses declined 1%, which included roughly $200 million with the shared success bonuses in late December that Brian mentioned plus an acceleration of planned charitable contributions in late December as we looked to share some of the future tax savings with our teams and the communities we serve.Provision expense was $1 billion, up $227 million, driven by a $333-million impact from the charge-off and reserve bill for a single commercial exposure. Negative news reports on that company caused significant market concerns, which affected the credit spreads and stock price of this formally investment-grade credit.Despite downgrades of this credit, both non-performing loans and criticized commercial exposures declined from Q3 and, excluding this specific loss, net charge-off remains very low turning. Turning to the balance sheet on Slide 4. Overall compared to September 30, end-of-period assets of $2.3 trillion were mostly unchanged. Loans grew $10 billion but were offset by a $14 billion decrease in cash.On the funding side, strong deposit growth from Q3 of $25 billion was offset by reductions in market funding and lower equity. Debt levels were stable with prior period. however, we did complete an $11 billion debt exchange offer in the quarter, which extended maturities and improved the structure of this debt from a [Inaudible] perspective. Liquidity remained strong, with average global liquidity sources of $522 billion, and we ended the quarter with a liquidity coverage ratio of 125%.Equity decreased $4.8 billion from Q3. This quarter, through both the purchase of common shares and common dividends, we returned more than $6.1 billion to shareholders. That was $4 billion more than the $2.1 billion in income available to common, which included the $2.9-billion tax act charge. The remaining decline in equity was mostly a result of the decline in OCI as increases in long-end rates decreased the value of our debt securities portfolio.We purchased 174 million shares in Q4 and have repurchased 509 million shares in the past 12 months. Remember, this quarter we received approval for $5 billion in share repurchases in addition to our previously announced $12.9 billion following CCAR. Tangible book value per share of $16.96 was modestly above Q4 '16, as earnings over the year including the tax act impact offset share repurchases and dividends, as well as the conversion of Berkshire preferred stock to common shares. Turning to regulatory metrics and focusing on the fully phased-in impacts, our CET1 ratio declined this quarter.The primary cause of the decline was a return of capital to shareholders in excess of earnings, which obviously included the tax act impact. Focusing on risk-weighted assets and starting with the advanced approach, RWA was flat from Q3 at $1.46 trillion as DTA reductions and the run-off of legacy loans with high risk weights offset general loan growth. Under the standardized approach where risk sensitivity is less, funded and unfunded loan growth across the businesses drove a $22 billion increase in RWA. The CET1 ratio under advanced declined 34 basis points to 11.5%, under standardized, the ratio declined 53 basis points to 11.7%.Both ratios remain well above our 9.5 requirement and supplemental leverage ratios continue to exceed U.S. regulatory minimums. Turning to Slide 5. On an average basis, total loans increased to $928 billion.Note that the Q2 sale of UK Card, which was recorded in all other impacted the year-over-year comparisons of average loans by $9 billion. In Q4, we also sold our remaining student loan and manufactured-housing loans, totaling approximately $800 million. Adjusting for these sales, average loans were up $29 billion, or 3% year over year. Loan growth continued to be dampened by the run-off of non-core consumer real-estate loans in all other.Year-over-year loans in all other were down $29 billion, inclusive of the loan sales. On the other hand, loans in our business segments were up $49 billion, or 6%. Consumer banking led with a 9% increase, with solid growth across mortgage, credit card, and vehicle loans. Wealth management's strong growth of 7% was driven by mortgages and structured lending.Origination of new home equity loans continued to be outpaced by pay-downs. Growth in global banking loans and leases remained solid, up 4% year over year. Switching to average deposits and looking at the bottom right, the growth was $43 billion or nearly 3.5% year over year. This growth was driven by consumer banking, which increased by $48 billion, or nearly 8% year over year.Average deposits declined year over year on wealth-management as clients moved cash to other alternatives within brokerage or AUM. This decline was mostly offset by solid growth in global banking.Turning to asset quality on Slide 6. Total net charge-offs were $1.2 billion, or 50 basis points of average loans. As mentioned, the quarter was impacted by the one large single commercial charge-off.Excluding the single loss, net charge-offs and the net charge-off ratio were consistent with Q3. Also, due largely to this commercial loss, provision of $1 billion was up $167 million Q3 '17 and $227 million dollars in Q4 '16. Provision expense included a $236 million net reserve release. The net reserve release reflects continued improvement in our legacy consumer, real-estate, and energy portfolio.Our reserve coverage remains strong with allowance of loan coverage ratio of 112 basis points and a coverage level 2.6 times our full-year net charge-offs.On Slide 7, we break out credit quality metrics for both consumer and commercial portfolios. With respect to consumer, net charge-offs of $769 million were up $38 million in Q3. The modest uptick in net losses is negatively impacted by the absence of some prior-period recoveries, the Q3 '17 storm-related payment deferrals, and seasonality. The consumer credit card net charge-off ratio increased to 2.78% as the portfolio continues its expected seasoning.Consumer MPL of $5.2 billion declined from Q3 and are at the lowest they've been since Q2 '08 and 45% of our consumer MPLs are current on their payments. Commercial losses, excluding the one large credit already discussed, were stable. Reservable criticized utliized exposure was down more than $1 billion from Q3.Turning to Slide 8, net-interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $11.5 billion, $11.7 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q4 '16, GAAP NII is up $1.2 billion, or more than 11%, driven by the spread improvement in our asset yields and funding cost.Partially offsetting the spread improvement is the lack of interest income associated with the UK Card portfolio, which was sold in Q2 '17. The increase year over year was also driven by growth in loans and [Inaudible] securities as well as lower prepayments and therefore lower bond premium write-offs. Focusing on the net-interest yield, it improved 16 basis points from Q4 '16, to 2.39%. Compared to Q3 '17, NII increased $300 million, driven by loans, securities, and asset growth in global markets, as well as a run-up of short-end rates in anticipation of the Fed [Inaudible].With respect to deposit pricing, we raised rates modestly on selected wealth-management products as well as for certain commercial clients. Consumer rates paid remained stable. NII on a full-year basis grew $3.6 billion, or 9%, to 44.7 billion. In 2018 we expect solid NII growth driven by loan and deposit growth and some net-interest-yield expansion, assuming the forward curve plays out as currently expected.But I would remind you that 2017 included approximately a half a billion dollars of interest from the UK Card business that we sold. This will be a significant offset to NII growth in 2018. In 2018, we also don't expect the same full-year benefit from the reduced premium amortization experienced in 2017, given the increase in rates that borrowers have already experienced. More short term, as you think about NII in Q1 '18, we expect to benefit from the December rate hike.Having said that, remember, there will be two less days in Q1 than Q4. That should reduce NII by approximately $175 million. Also, NII from loan growth in Q1 is normally muted by seasonal declines in card loans. One other item worth noting as you think about Q1, the tax act will lower NII on an FTE basis because the NII gross-up will be lower.However, remember, NII gross-up on an FTE basis is completely offset by higher tax expense, resulting in no change in earnings. Still, on an FTE basis, NII is expected to decrease by approximately $120 million each quarter. On a GAAP basis, again, NII is not impacted. With respect to asset sensitivity as of 12/31, an instantaneous 100-basis-point parallel increase in rates is estimate to increase NII by $3.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months.This is largely unchanged from September 30 and approximately two-thirds driven by our sensitivity to short-term rates.Turning to Slide 9, we had another solid quarter of expense management. Note this quarter includes an accounting change for the retirement-eligible incentives. Previously this expense, which was historically just over $1 billion, was recorded in Q1 when awards were granted. We will now account for an estimate of the next year's grant ratably over current year's four quarters.Prior periods and this quarter's supplemental materials have been restated for this change. Non-interest expense of $13.3 billion was down $140 million, or 1%, from Q4 '16. Note that this amount includes two actions which totaled approximately $200 million that I mentioned earlier to share [Inaudible] tax savings with lower-paid employees and the communities we serve. Excluding these discretionary actions, expenses were down 2%.In addition to cost savings associated with the sale of our UK card business, year-over-year improvements and non-interest expense were broadly distributed across expense categories as we continue to focus on [Inaudible], understanding and improving our work processes, and optimizing the company's consumer delivery network. We expect these benefits over the medium term to drive efficiencies that will help us offset inflationary costs and potentially increases in investment. Compared to Q3 '17, expenses declined by $120 million despite the late-quarter discretionary spend. Decline was driven by lower mortgage servicing costs and lower revenue-related incentives in our global markets business.Excluding the tax act's impacts on revenue, our efficiency ratio of 62% was above our target, reflecting the typical seasonal weakness in our sales and trading business. OK, turning to the business segments and starting with consumer banking on Slide 10, Q4 caps a tremendous year for this business. On a full-year basis earnings were $8.2 billion, growing 14% over 2016, with operating leverage driving the efficiency ratio to 50% by the end of the year. Focusing on our Q4 results, earnings at $2.2 billion grew 14% year over year and returned 24% on allocated capital.Year over year, this business created over 600 basis points of operating leverage, as revenue growth of 10% outpaced expense growth of 4%, Higher interest rates and growth in client balances drove the year-over-year improvement in revenue. Year-over-year average loans grew 9%, average deposits grew 8%, and Merrill Edge brokerage assets grew 22%. Cost of deposits, which reflects non-interest expenses as a percent of average deposits increased modestly because of the year-end discretionary actions mentioned earlier, the share of future tax savings with lower-paid employees and the communities we serve. Net charge-offs increased $107 million from Q4 '16 as we continue to experience modest and expected seasoning of our credit card portfolio and loan growth.Provisional expense increased to $126 million in Q4 '16 and that charge-off ratio remains low at 1.21%.Turning to Slide 11 and looking at key trends, as I mentioned earlier, revenue increased 10% year over year. Within the revenue, mortgage banking income was the only major category that was lower year over year, driven by volume decline. In Q4 we retained about 90% of our first mortgage production on balance sheet. Looking at revenue more broadly, we believe our relationship-deepening [Inaudible] award program is improving NII and growth of balances and allowing cost savings.These benefits are more than offsetting headwinds in the non-interest income line that our industry is facing. Spending levels on debit and credit cards were up 7% year over year and we issued 1.1 million new credit cards in the quarter, in line with last year. Spending levels and a one-time partner rebate drove a 5% revenue increase in card income, which continues to be impacted by strong competition on the rewards front. Service charges were up a more modest 1% and in 4Q we modestly revised our overdraft policy by eliminating certain fees.This revision reduced overall fees but has benefits in that it will improve customer satisfaction while helping to lower servicing cost. By the way, customer satisfaction in consumer banking reached an historic high, with roughly 80% of our clients rating us 9 or 10 on a 10-point scale. Focusing on client balances on the bottom of the page, you can see the success we've continued to have growing deposits, loans, and brokerage assets. We remained focused on prime and super-prime borrowers with average booked FICO scores of at least 760.Expenses were up 4% compared to Q4 '16, as the year-end special bonus impacted this business more heavily than others. Otherwise, investments in renovating branches and technology initiatives modestly outpaced continued optimization and saving from digitalization. To give you a sense of the type and level of continued investment in our financial centers, let me highlight a few facts. During 2017 we opened 30 new financial centers, with 25 of these in no-go areas not previously served by our retail network but in areas where we have existing wealth-management and/or commercial banking presence.We also opened 41 student centers and 69 lending centers and branded 585 Merrill Lynch officers. We also renovated nearly 300 financial centers and replaced more than 3,400 ATMs.Turning to Slide 12 and focusing on the continuing improvement in digital banking trends, as you can see, the year-over-year growth in these metrics continues to be impressive. We remain the leader in digital banking. We now have nearly 35 million digital users, including 24 million accessing their accounts through mobile devices.We processed payments for customers valued at $669 billion in Q4. Annualized, that equates to over $2.5 trillion per yea. And note the 10% growth of digital payments relative to non-digital at 1% as customers continue to migrate from cash and check, helping us improve efficiency and reduce risks. In particular, note P2P payments increasing.They doubled from Q4 '16 as the adoption of Zelle makes it easier to send, request, and even split person-to-person money transfer. Also note on the bottom left the growth in mobile channel users, with 1.3 billion log-ins. Also noteworthy is the volume of mobile deposit transactions which now represents 23% of all deposit transactions and while still small, half of all our retail direct auto loan applications are originated digitally following the recent rollout of our digital auto shopping capabilities last quarter. These digital trends and the investment behind them, plus the continued investment in our financial centers that I earlier listed, must be thought of together as you evaluate and we execute on our high-tech, high-touch customer strategy.Turning to global wealth management on Slide 13, [INAUDIBLE] earnings $742 million, up 17% from Q4 '16, a pre-tax margin of 26% and a return on allocated capital of 21%.Market appreciation and client flows were once again a tailwind for asset-management fees, offsetting modest spread compression. At the same time, brokerage revenue continued to face headwinds as volumes declined and mix shifted. All in, revenue grew 7% year over year, with strong NII improvement and 16% growth in asset-management fees partially offset by lower brokerage revenues. This activity, coupled with careful expense management, drove 4% operating leverage.This quarter we saw AUM flows of $18 billion, bringing flows for the year to nearly $100 billion. Year-over-year expenses were up 3%, driven by revenue-related incentives as well as investments in both primary sales professionals and technology. Over to Slide 14. We [Inaudible] solid, overall client engagement.Client balances rose to $2.75 trillion, driven by higher market values, solid AUM flows, and continued loan growth. As we noted during reviews of previous quarters, clients started to more appreciably move deposits into cash investment alternatives within AUM and brokerage starting early in the year. In the second half of the year, trends improved after we increased rate paid on certain products. Average loans of $157 billion grew 7% year over year, continuing a trend of clients deepening their relationship with us.Loan growth remained concentrated in consumer real estate as well as structured lending. Turning to Slide 15, global banking earned $1.7 billion, increasing 6% from Q4 '16. Return on allocated capital was 17% and stable with last year despite an increase in allocated capital. I want to talk about full-year results for a moment to highlight the success of this business in 2017.On a full-year basis, global banking set several records, including revenue of $20 billion and net income of $7 billion. Full-year earnings were up 21% on strong operating leverage. Revenue grew 8% while expenses were up only 1% as the business reduced overhead to offset increases in investments. And we added more than 400 new bankers over the past two years as we continue to deepen and expand local coverage and commercial and business banking.Returning to Q4 year-over-year comparisons, revenue growth of 10% was driven by improved NII, reflecting solid loan and deposit growth compounded by rising short-term interest rates. We also grew IB fees 16% year over year. Growth was led by advisory fees but debt and equity fees were also up year over year. The efficiency ratio improved 200 basis points to 42%.Provision expense of $132 million increased from Q4 '16 as a result of the commercial charge-off mentioned earlier. Half of the loss was recorded in global banking and half in global markets. Provision expense also included some release of reserves on our energy portfolio, which continued to improve. Growth of loans in global banking remained fairly consistent, with past several quarters increasing 4% year over year.the outlook for loan growth given tax reform remains to be seen, but optimism among our clients is high. However, we also expect some of our clients to use repatriated funds and tax savings to pay down borrowings and other obligations. Looking at trends on Slide 16 and comparing to Q4 last year, with respect to average loans, growth of 4% was led by corporate borrowers evenly balanced between domestic and international clients. Within commercial lending, C&I rose 5% while commercial real estate was flat.In global banking, loans growth was down 1 basis point compared to Q3 '17, continuing the trend we've seen all year which modestly compressed spreads year over year by mid-single digits. Average deposits rose $14 billion, or 5%, compared to Q4 2016 with most of the increase concentrated in the second half of the year, reflecting increases in rates paid in Q3 and Q4. As interest rates rise, the value of these deposits and the relationships they represent is best seen in global transaction revenue, which is up 10% year over year to nearly $2 billion. Total investment banking fees $1.4 billion finished the year strong growing 16% versus Q4 '16.Advisory fees hit a new record. For full-year 2017, we remained ranked No. 3 in overall investment banking fees with fees totaling $6 billion, up 15% from 2016.OK, switching to global markets on Slide 17. I'll review results excluding DVA.Global markets generated revenue of $3.5 billion and earned half a billion dollars. Year-over-year earnings were down by $238 million, driven by lower sales and trading results, higher technology investment spending, and provision. Revenue is down 2% year over year as a decline in sales and trading revenue was partially offset by a gain on the sale of a non-core asset recorded in other income. Sales and trading revenue held up better from the middle of the quarter-end through the end of the year than it did in the prior year.Trading of $2.7 billion declined 9% from Q4 '16. FICC sales and trading of $1.7 billion decreased 13% [Inaudible] the decrease was driven by less favorable market conditions across macro products [Inaudible]. Equity sales and trading, at just shy of $1 billion, was stable year over year as growth in client financing activity offset declines in cash and derivatives-trading given lower levels of volatility and client activity. With respect to expenses, Q4 '17 was 5% higher than Q4 '16 as lower revenue-related incentive costs were more than offset by continued investments in technology.Moving to trends on Slide 18 and looking at trends across the last three years, we would highlight the following. First, starting in the lower left box, full years of trading revenue has been fairly consistent over the last three years at $13 billion to $13.6 billion and note that we have achieved this stability while reducing our [Inaudible] RWA. Now, [Inaudible] over the last three years and that change was reflected in client activity and volatility that varied greatly from both a product and regional perspective over the last three years. Still, we were able to produce relatively consistent revenue on reduced risk over this time period.We believe this consistency shows that clients value the diversity and comprehensiveness of our global markets capabilities, including sales and trading as well as research in every major market across the globe. On Slide 19 we show all other, which reported a loss of $2.7 billion. A few things to note this quarter: The $2.9 billion impact from the tax act was recorded here. So, excluding that charge, all other would have produced a profit of a little over $200 million.Unrelated to the tax act, all other results also include [Inaudible]. Revenues compared to Q4 '16 [Inaudible] were down a little more than $130 million year over year. Remember when comparing year over year, Q4 '16 included expenses and charge-offs for the UK Card portfolio sold in 2017. The tax rate this quarter was impacted by the negative impacts of the tax act as well as the benefit of the unrelated subsidiary restructuring.With respect to tax rate in 2018, prior to tax reform, we expected our GAAP tax rate for 2018 to be around 29% before unusual items. Now we expect the GAAP tax rate to be approximately 20% absent unusual items. And remember when thinking about the tax rate on an FTE basis, the difference between GAAP and FTE has now narrowed from 2 basis points to 1 basis point. This reflects a preliminary analysis of the non-deductibility of FDIC premiums, the global mix of our profits, and other tax reform provisions.OK, let me turn it back to Brian for a couple of closing comments before we open it up for Q&A.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Paul. As we wrap up, we thought it would be useful to hit a couple of questions from the top that Paul and I've been fielding as tax reform becomes more of a reality. The first question we get often is, how do our clients and how do we feel about the tax reform and the client activity. It's clear from what our clients tell us that tax reform will be a positive for our clients and customers in the United States.There are two key elements from the standpoint of corporate America tax reform: first, the lower competitive tax rate, and second, a territorial system, and both of these were accomplished in the tax reform. This coupled with the continued regulatory-reform agenda to balance regulation, are well-received by businesses, and this increased confidence will ultimately make it, and undoubtedly make it into the business plan. As one of the largest banks in the United States, we will benefit with that as our customers grow and invest. That being said, those customers just as we at Bank of America will look and our peers in our industry are carefully evaluating alternatives to reinvest some portion of those savings to drive further business activity to help grow our company and achieve even more competitiveness.The second question I gets is, does our focus change and will we run the company differently given a lower tax rate and the [Inaudible] is no. We're going to remain focused on driving responsible growth, continually trying to connect better with our customers, striving to make it easier for those customers do business with us, and for our employees do business inside the company. We'll continue to drive operational excellence, lowering operational expenses as we've done for many quarters in a row, and improving our competitiveness as we develop and invest in new products and services. We will also continue to drive our share-return model and we expect the largest portion of benefits in tax reform to be delivered to you, our shareholders.In the end, whether through increased investments, capital distributions, or supporting our clients, all this will benefit the economy and shareholders and drive our activities consistent with responsible growth. The third question is, do we think that the impact of tax reform will affect loan growth. Near term it'll be tougher to judge as people repatriate money or receive more after-tax cash flow. The question is, will they pay it on loans, and perhaps they will.However, over the medium to long term, having more after-tax cash flow can't but be good for business and we will benefit by greater loan growth as those businesses invest those proceeds. We believe the real test for our loan growth will be more the general economy and how it's growing and less about the tax rate.Another question we often get is, does the tax reform change our commitment to a $53 billion goal for 2018. I started out by pointing out that if you look at our expenses in the fourth quarter, we effective reached a run-rate expense in the $53 billion range. We reported for $13.3 billion in the quarter, if you back out the $200 million in additional bonuses and the accelerated charitable contribution, that leaves us just about $13.1 billion.You multiply that times four and that's $52.25 or so billion. If you add $400 million in the FICA-related tax to come in the first quarter and throw in on top of that a couple of hundred million dollars of potential incentives due to the fourth quarter being a lower trading quarter, you get to around a $53 billion run rate. So, effectively we've reached our goal. In the second quarter of 2016 when we first announced this goal, I want to remind you that the expenses that we were trailing at that time were $56 billion.It was in our business plan to hit $53 billion in 2018 and it still is. But as we look forward, we have no doubt, as I said earlier, that businesses including our company will have to look at taking advantages of some of the tax savings to invest to improve their business [Inaudible] faster than they would have done before the tax-reform act. So we continue to evaluate options for longer-term value creation along the dimensions of investments we've been making in branches, in technology and people. We'll continue to assess as we move through the year, however, to be clear we'd expect most of the benefits from tax reform'll flow to the bottom line through dividends and share buybacks over time.In addition, the investments we make will drive operational excellence and efficiency that will continue to play to our benefit over time.The next question I get is around capital return expectations: Will they change given the tax reform. The simple answer to that question is yes. In 2017 we reported net income available to common shareholders as $16.6 billion and returned $16.8 billion back through share repurchase and dividends. We don't need to make any acquisitions in the company, in fact in the United States, deposit acquisition's not legal.So all growth will have to be organic and will continue to be so. We believe we have sufficient capital to absorb our risks as we grow and in fact we have excess capital. We have the capital to also support our customers' demand for financing and we always want to use that capital first to help customers grow. So, yes, we will expect to return more capital to shareholders given the tax act.That brings us to the last question I often hear from investors: How are you performing against your return targets and do they need to increase with the tax savings implied in tax reform act going forward that Paul spoke about? This year, excluding the impact of the tax act, our return on tangible common equity was 11% and return on assets of 93 basis points.They're just shy of the 12% and 1% targets that we laid out a few years ago. Going forward, the benefits from tax reform will easily mathematically accelerate those and we'll reach those targets. The potential lift in returns can be seen by just adding the benefits of the lower tax rate. Assuming 100% of the benefits go to the bottom line, this would equate to something north of 150 basis points of increased return on tangible common equity and more than 10 basis points of increased return on average assets.But keep in mind, we've always been clear that the long-term targets were just a step to keep marking our continued path to driving this company's operating performance. CSR targets will be obtained but that doesn't lower our desire to drive responsible growth to continue to improve the company and continue to improve the returns and return the capital to you and we will continue to do that.So, wrapping up, we will stay focused on responsible growth in 2018. That's what got us here and what will get us here going forward. We will control the things we can do and drive operating leverage through the company.And with that, let me open up for Q&A.OperatorAt this time, ladies and gentlemen, if you would like to ask a question, please press *, then 1 on your touchtone phone. You may withdraw your question at any time by pressing the # key. Once again, it's *, then 1 to ask a question. And we can take our first question from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Your line is now open.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGood morning. Brian, I just wanted to follow up on one of the comments you made around the expenses. As you indicated in the prepared remarks, the expense improvement has been fantastic, in particular in the consumer business where operating leverage has been very strong over the last two years. I wanted to understand from your prepared remarks, you were saying that $53 billion, you've already met it and you'll retain it for the full year or may change your outlook based on how the customer demand evolves with the tax plan and within that, just wondering if you're expecting that you'll be able to generate more operating leverage, in particular in the consumer space given the groundwork you've laid in digital payments and the branch network.Good morning. Brian, I just wanted to follow up on one of the comments you made around the expenses. As you indicated in the prepared remarks, the expense improvement has been fantastic, in particular in the consumer business where operating leverage has been very strong over the last two years. I wanted to understand from your prepared remarks, you were saying that $53 billion, you've already met it and you'll retain it for the full year or may change your outlook based on how the customer demand evolves with the tax plan and within that, just wondering if you're expecting that you'll be able to generate more operating leverage, in particular in the consumer space given the groundwork you've laid in digital payments and the branch network.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSure. I think what we're saying is that, just start from the base principle, the vast majority of any increased after-tax cash flow would go to the shareholders. The question that we have to look at, Betsy, as you referenced is, is there an amount of investment that we have to make to accelerate some of the things we're doing, especially around consumer business but across all the business, accelerate -- the branch buildout in some of the cities has proved to be very successful. [Inaudible] we would do over five years, do you wanna speed it up a little bit? Or do we invest a little bit more in technology, especially to make the next major move in the markets businesses, which Tom and the team are driving at, to get, even with stable revenues, to start to drive the profit back up again, or in the treasury services business? So, the debate is, is there some amount you'd invest to help accelerate growth but it would be along the dimensions that we've been doing, and it would just improve our ability to get them done and speed it up.It would be modest, I think, is the best way to say it.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOK and then on the consumer business, the operating leverage has obviously been extraordinary in the last two years. Is there more to come this year?Brian Moynihan -- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYea. We want to focus all of you across all the business operating leverage and they've shown good progress, the company as a whole, and each of the businesses. In consumer [Inaudible] continue to get operating leverage. They've done a great job.You see the branches are down 100 and some year over year. The digital transactions continue to go up, but there's a lot of room to go still, even though we think we've made great progress in digital, and we have, only 22% of the deposits are made digitally and about 30% are made over the counter at the branches. So as we continue to get customers to adopt these new and exciting technologies, we'll see more operating leverage but the team's done a great job there and I think they'll continue to improve it. Likewise, you're going to see some of the transformation we're doing in the wealth-management business continue to grow and Terry and Andy and Katy and the team are doing a great job.That business has grown but we need to start to drive some of the digitization techniques that we used in other business, including commercial business, into that business which you'll see, and that will help the operating leverage there. And in the commercial business, it's very efficient. So, it's very hard-fought to get much expense but even then they still have done a good job of taking the expense leverage through the changes and the underwriting ways we do business, how we underwrite -- centrally versus de-centrally and things like that. so, it'll be across the board and we expect more out of consumer.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOK, thanks, and then just last question on the dividend-payout ratio. I realize that earning's up with a lower tax rate. Do you expect you'll keep that dividend-payout ratio flat or how are you thinking about the dividend and overall capital return?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe basically said we're moving toward a 30% payout ratio of earnings and I think that would mathematically follow what you just laid out, the fact that if tax earnings go up, it'd be higher number. We're not quite there yet but we're pushing toward that direction.Betsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOK, thanks a lot, Brian.OperatorAnd we can take our next question from John McDonald with Bernstein. Your line is now open.John McDonald --Bernstein -- AnalystHi, good morning. Brian, thanks for the comments on expenses and how you're thinking about some of the tax impacts and maybe accelerating investments. I guess, kind of just coming back to that, if we think about, you got through this $53 billion, you're kind of there now, is this a level where you feel like you could run the company and kind of have some kind of maybe just core inflation associated with the economy? Are you still reinvesting cost-saves but you're still taking out cost some places and reinvesting in other? If you think about 2019, you're beyond this $53 billion kind of where you want to be or should we think about an efficiency and ratio set of goals for the next year? Is that a better way to think about it?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think, as we said before, the key is to drive operating leverage as Betsy referenced, John, and continue to drive that across the businesses. A couple things. We've been clear that we decide the discussion about the invests on the proceeds of taxes but basically, the $53 billion was a rate that we could kind of sustain around, i.e. continuing to invest in operational improvement over time and keeping a relatively flat.And you are dealing with inflation and things like that that creep up on you. And so, we had a pretty good dynamic going and the sole question is do you want to invest a bit to speed up and that would just increase that number by a bit and then play over the next couple of years but the basic principle's to run a company relatively flat through continued investment and cost-effectiveness is still -- we've still got a lot of room ahead of us. I always come back, John, and you've followed our company closely, we will continue to have the same rigor around the way we run the company. Just because the tax rate is lower doesn't change how we're going to do it.So, we're going to keep driving that analysis that says how much can we invest in building this operational excellence campaign we're on. We just see tremendous opportunity to keep applying digitization to paper and the work and the company and continue to drive that. So some of these investments will be branches or people or salespeople, and have been, and the businesses, but on the other hand we're investing tremendously in effectiveness in the company and we'll continue to do that.John McDonald --Bernstein -- AnalystOK. And then just for Paul on the overdraft policy, understanding the long-term franchise value of the new policy, trying to think about the near-term financial impact. Is there any kind of pull-through or continuation of drag on deposit fees that might come from the new overdraft policy or is that impact maybe fully in the fourth quarter numbers yet?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI would say that you're going to see that next year, if I were modeling it, you want a probably low single-digit impact.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt came in partway through the fourth quarter. So a good chunk of it's in there, John, so it'd be a modest impact beyond that.John McDonald --Bernstein -- AnalystOK, thank you.OperatorWe can take our next question from Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Your line is now open.Steven Chubak --Nomura Instinet -- AnalystHi, good morning. So, I wanted to start with a question on credit outlook. Delinquency trends remain quite favorable. Brian, you noted that NPL declined both consumer and commercial.I'm just wondering how we should be thinking about the provision outlook in the coming quarters. Is it still reasonable for us to expect that to traject in line with charge-offs to maybe some upward growth as the loan portfolio continues to season, so maybe somewhere in the range of like $900 million to a billion? Is that a reasonable expectationBrian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe expect credit to continue to perform the way it performed in the first three quarters of 2017, which we would characterize as solid if not excellent. We would expect provision to roughly match net charge-offs, with reserve releases moderating over time as we continue to build allowance and support of loan growth. Those releases are being driven by non-core consumer real estate and energy.Steven Chubak --Nomura Instinet -- AnalystOK and just one clarifying question for me on the expense side. I know that Betsy and John had already touched on this a little bit but I just wanted to clarify the guidance that you guys had actually given on the last earnings call. Brian, it was in the Q&A where you alluded to the fact that you expect expenses to be flattish in 2019. I know you're very focused on digitization and automation.I just want to confirm whether that's still a reasonable expectation. Just because it looks like most people are contemplating some expense ramp from 2018 to 2019.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe'd expect that all things being equal, they would be flattish and that's what we've told you. The question is, we took a little bit of money and accelerate investments and kind of run through a couple of years and probably drop back off but it's be very modest and in the greater context. A lot of those investments get capitalized, the near-term P&L impact's different, but basically from a conceptual framework, we think we can run the company and that, below $53 billion on a consistent basis for the next couple of years with a caveat that we may look to invest part of the tax savings on top of that and well be very clear if we do that.Steven Chubak --Nomura Instinet -- AnalystAnd one final one for me just regarding the remarks on the wealth-management side. Brian, you talked about efforts to invest in technology to drive improved profitability. In the past, you had alluded to a 30% margin target. I didn't know if that was still a reasonable expectation that you guys could get to.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYea, I think we're at 27 this quarter, 26-27, 26, we've been bouncing around there. It's the target to get to. I think mechanically there's some things that help us over the next couple of years in terms some stuff running off that pushes this up. So we continue to do that.What we're talking about is a more fundamental reset on a couple of things. Obviously, in the lower affluent businesses we're driving Merrill Edge and things as a more efficient platform by definition and secondly, there is a lot of paper in this business and a lot of work, even the advisors themselves, there's a lot of automation of work they do that will make it easier for them so they can become more efficient and handle more clients [Inaudible]. But if you think about the core pre-tax margin, it'll move up and we still believe we can get it up around 30 and the deposit side helps that as the arbitrage from rates goes through that business.Steven Chubak --Nomura Instinet -- AnalystExcellent. Thanks for taking my questions.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.Glenn Schorr --Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi, thank you. Hopefully, this is simple and I know you can't talk for the regulators but all else equal, have you thought through how the tax act might impact the CCAR process, meaning I see just a lot higher PP&R and it shouldn't impact anything else in a vacuum but just curious if I'm missing something there.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI don't think you're missing anything. I think all companies, all banks are going to keep more of what they earn. That's going to increase our profits. So, we're going to be in a better position to return more capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks.Glenn Schorr --Evercore ISI -- AnalystAnd then just switching over to wealth management, a couple of little questions. No. 1, where's all the growth coming from, meaning you noted the strong flows. Curious what's current versus new clients.And you also noted advisors are up 3%. Is that training or is that recruiting? Just curious.Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerLook, the FA reflects really our continued investment in the training program. Some experienced hires offset by sort of the normal kind of attrition which has been very low particularly in competitive losses.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerPaul, just remember, just to be clear, we have changed our recruiting. We announced that six months ago where we had been recruiting in sort of the traditional way. So, most of the growth is coming through our advisor-training platform, which we consolidated between the people who work in a branch and the people who work in the Merrill office. They're brought under one big training program, again, for effectiveness and we think there's great prospects for that.It will take a few years for that to play out, obviously.Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSo as you think about the numbers, it's just AUM growth, which is being driven by market levels, being driven by increased flows. It's being driven by some new households and we're very focused on that. That's offset by a little bit of spread compression and decline in transactional revenues that we've been seeing now for a couple of years.Glenn Schorr --Evercore ISI -- AnalystOK, last follow up, if I could. Your decision to stay in protocol is a little different than a handful of the large peers. Just curious, your thought process and experience so far.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe experience so far has been relatively modest in terms of anything. People have been changing their opinions, but we continue to monitor the market, we figure out what we want to do but we haven't changed our position yet.Glenn Schorr --Evercore ISI -- AnalystOK, thank you.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.Matt O'Connor --Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning. I was hoping to follow up on the outlook for net-interest income for the full year. You mentioned some of the drags from the card business. I guess in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't seem like a $500 million drag from card is really that material.Obviously, you had good [Inaudible] growth year over year. So, just trying to get a little better sense of maybe the magnitude of [Inaudible] that you're looking for. And then if you want to give us the bond premium amortization, how much benefit that was this year versus last, that might be helpful.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLook, we expect solid NII growth in 2018 from continued sort of NIM expansion as well as loan and deposit growth. I think the size of the increase is going to depend upon the amount of loan growth and [Inaudible] rate increasing along the forward curve, and obviously our ability to manage deposit rate paid. With respect the bond premiums, what I would point out was that in 2017 we got a benefit of approximately $700 million from lower bond amortization driven by slower prepayments as long-end rates moved up at the end of 2016. So, you really can't expect that to repeat itself this year given that that curve is not linear, it's convex, and we've already had a big increase in rates.So, we're not going to get the same decline in the future of prepayment speeds. You noted and I would also note that 2017 included half of UK Card and then you've gotta factor in FTE but all that said, we feel good about 2018 NII growth. We think it's gonna be solid. It's going to be back to basics growing loans, growing deposits, managing deposit rate paid well.Matt O'Connor --Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOk, it's helpful. And then just separately on the retail deposit side, you mentioned essentially no repricing there and it's consistent, I think, with what we're seeing for most of your big peers but just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of when there does start being a little bit of upward pressure, there, and being the biggest deposit player, you might be one of the kind of setters in the price there as we think about rates going forward.Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI'm not sure how helpful I'm going to be to you. I would just make a couple of points that we've made many times. The industry really hasn't seen on the retail side deposit rates increase sort of much or at all on traditional counts and I think it's important just to remind everybody that Bank of America delivers a lot of value to depositors. You've got transparency, convenience, safety, mobile banking, nationwide network, advice and counsel.I think all of this plus a lack of market pressure so far has kept deposit rates relatively low. You've seen rates rising in [Inaudible] and global banking. Look, at some point rates are going to rise and my guess is we're getting close to that point, given the expected Fed fund rate hikes here in 2018. We just don't know though.What all I can tell you is that we're going to balance our customer needs and we're going to balance the competitive marketplace with our shareholders' interest and we're going to do the right thing for all the parties.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI'll just add a couple of things. One, the pricing strategy in consumer's largely driven on depth of relationship. So, as we look at pricing tiers and how we do it and set by market, set by product, set by customer type and relationship, the rewards programs that reward deposit balance along with lower rates on loans and other types of things, it's an integrated business and a lot of people focus on the one aspect of it and try to isolate it but it's actually a very integrated business. But to give you a couple other things, what holds us down is, as you look at deposits year over year and consumer up $47 billion, the checking, which is always going to be very low, it was up $30 billion of the $47 billion, or $29 billion of the $37 billion and CDs are down $4 billion again.So, even we've run off CDs. So, that dynamic is always going to lead to an all-in deposit price for basis points that looks lower, but it's the quality of the checking, franchise and core franchise we have. I think we had the average checking balance in consumer reach $7,000 this quarter. They're all prime core-transaction accounts for the household, which means the paycheck's coming in and that's what's driving the overall structure of the business and will continue to do so.Matt O'Connor --Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOK, thank you very much.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.Mike Mayo --Wells Fargo -- AnalystHi. What is your total technology spending, say, for 2017? How did that compare to 2016? Where do you expect that to be for 2018?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, to be comparable, you have to understand what the components are but the component most people focus on is what we call technology initiatives or coded programming. That's about $2.7 billion and relatively flat.Mike Mayo --Wells Fargo -- AnalystRelatively flat for 2016 and 2017. What about for 2018?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerRelatively flat for 2017 and 2018. We are getting, even the way the program, a little bit of efficiency, the nominal number for 2017 [Inaudible] higher than that and the number for '18 will be lower than that but it's largely getting the same amount of work done for a little less efficiency, a little less cost per dollar per programming unit, for lack of a better term. So, that's been fairly constant across time and we continue to evaluate that level of spending at all times.Mike Mayo --Wells Fargo -- AnalystSo, going back to Slide 12 for the consumer banking digital trends, are you spending more money in those areas as you get more traction? I mean, you see 23% of mobile deposit transactions that are digital. I mean, where do you want to take that 23% number and do you need to spend more to get there?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, I think when you talk about technology, yea, the consumer bankers benefit by a lot of technology spending across a lot of dimensions including the way we distribute the environment to the branches, use of tablet type technology in our branches to interface with customers, better call center technology. It is a tremendous investment in the consumer. On the digital side, specifically we will travel with the customer and we're getting the customers to understand the value of instead of going to ATM to deposit a check, do it with their phone, or instead of going to a branch to deposit, do it with their phone but we can't get ahead of them. We have to walk with them and help them do it and help them grow and that 23% number from three or four years ago as you see on the page, Mike, that 12%, it's a meaningful amount.It's about 1,000 branches of activity go through the phone. So, we'll continue to drive that but I think, yes, we've invested but it's not necessarily what we've invested this year, it's the $1 billion we've probably invested in mobile technology over the last five, six years to get us here that now we're taking advantage of. And then, as you know, [Inaudible] comes out, the Merrill Edge capabilities continue to improve to help in the [Inaudible] America. So, there's a lot of stuff behind it.So, think about the spending of $2.5 billion to $3 billion in technology, think of us having done that for a long time and think of some of those benefits now coming through. So, it's not like we have to accelerate spending to get the mobile behavior. It's actually a change in customer behavior, which is less about the technology. It's more about getting the customer to move their behavior.Mike Mayo --Wells Fargo -- AnalystYou guys have said take a look at all these trends collectively on Slide 12 but don't look at one in isolation. So, what sort of metric should we monitor externally to gauge your progress? Would it be, for example, the consumer banking efficiency ratio or is there one all-encompassing number or how would you suggest that we think about this?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, I think the efficiency ratio, when the team tells me that they have it down to 50 and they're gonna get below 50, and they take great solace in that, I tell them ""Don't take great solace in that because we don't know how low it could go"" but the one I think I'd argue is that we've always looked at is if you look on Page 10, Mike, the average cost of deposits. If you take the entirety of running this system as a percent of deposit which you can benchmark equal relatively clearly in the industry, you'll see that we run about 160 basis points -- that's the phones, the mobile, the technology, people, and all that stuff against the deposit base. That has come down over the last seven, eight years from 300 basis points to 161 basis points. That is a simple way for people to think of the impact of all this transformation activity in your effectiveness and efficiency in the business.Also, you wouldn't want to do this if your customer scores are suffering during that timeframe. The customer scores have risen, as Paul said earlier, to record heights. You can't get ahead of the customer and you can't push the customer do something that they don't want to do. Hence the challenge is to keep that cost efficiency at 161 basis points to be the benchmark while improving customer experience.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd, Mike, [Inaudible] you got to focus on operating leverage. That's a key thing that we're looking at all the time and holding people accountable to in addition to efficiency and then all the other individual metrics across mobile adoption and digital sales.Mike Mayo --Wells Fargo -- AnalystLast follow-up just on that last point, Brian. A lot of investors have voiced concern that the internet digital banking will be the demise of the deposit, that deposits will flee more quickly. What's your short answer to that concern?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think year over year the consumer business grew $47 billion over, again, deposit growth. I think that sort of speaks for itself, Mike.Mike Mayo --Wells Fargo -- AnalystAll right, thanks.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.Ken Usdin --Jefferies -- AnalystThanks, good morning. If I could follow up on the loan side, 6% year over year in core business, pretty decent rate and you're seeing growth across. Just wondering what are your expectations for loan growth as you look out, and in a bigger sense any sense of just movement in commercial and corporate America in terms of starting to think about investing more in their businesses?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWe feel really good about loan growth. Clearly, tax reform is going to make businesses and individuals have more money in their pocket and we think that's going to stimulate economic activity. We think the tax reform has made America stronger, there's been more investment there because we've leveled the playing field. So, medium, long term, even short term I think we're very optimistic about loan growth with a slight caveat that people are repatriating some funds.So, we're going to see what effect there is in the short term really on large corporate international kind of borrowers. At a more detailed level, we feel like we've been growing well in mortgage and we're going to [Inaudible] that's going to be offset by home equity run-off, card's been growing well in the fourth quarter. I would note that seasonally card balance is usually done in the first quarter. Auto has been growing strongly historically.That's going to soften or has softened. Again, I would remind everybody that we are focused on prime and super-prime and we didn't follow the market out to extended the durations but we're still holding our own there and expect slight modest growth next year. And on the commercial side, we've been growing loans at mid-single digits and, again, subject to what happens with repatriated funds here in the short term, I don't see any reason to change our expectations around loan growth.Ken Usdin --Jefferies -- AnalystPaul, is there any change in the rate of run-off in the all-other bucket from that $71 billion bucket? How fast are you expecting that to still run off?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThe way I'd characterize it going forward is it's going to run off sort of four to five to six per quarter, call it five.Ken Usdin --Jefferies -- AnalystOK, one quick one. Mortgage is a small line but it had a big swing, $300 million to a negative, especially that other line. Can you just talk us through what the couple hundred million-dollar negative was in the other part of mortgage and if that's recurring or just a one-time thing?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYea, sure. You're talking about the MBI one, right?Ken Usdin --Jefferies -- AnalystYes.Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSo, we had [Inaudible] warranty provision of approximately $200 million to resolve some claims. If you exclude that and you look quarter over quarter, the decline in mortgage banking income reflected lower production volume in a small mortgage market as well as lower servicing income. As the size of that portfolio continues to decline, keep in mind that mortgage banking income line is just simply becoming less relevant since we are now retaining 90% of our originations on the balance sheet. And coming back to the [Inaudible] warranty of $200 million to resolve a claim, if you take a look at the litigation line this quarter, it was a little bit lower than normal.So, we're resolving claims. Sometimes they show up on litigation. Sometimes they show up on [Inaudible] warranty but there's a little bit of geography there.Ken Usdin --Jefferies -- AnalystGot it. All right, thanks a lot, Paul.OperatorAnd we will take our next question from Saul Martinez with UBS. Your line is open.Saul Martinez --UBS -- AnalystHi, thank you. Saul Martinez. A couple of questions. I just wanted to go back, Brian, to the comments on your ROTCE and your ROA targets obviously with the bump from tax reform, you hit and you exceed the 12% and the 1% target that you previously laid out but as you go forward, you benefit from the lower tax rate, you sort of right-size your efficiency, get to the $53 billion and drive positive operating leverage from there, rates normalize.Not to put words in your mouth but it seems like it's pretty easy to get to sort of to the mid- to high-teen ROTCE and ROAs well in excess of 1 but do you have a view on where you think your ROTCE can get to over the next couple of years and where ROAs can get to over the next couple of years if things progress as you think they might?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think that you in your question sort of state it for yourself, which is yes, there will be a mathematical bump that will make it, quote, easy to get there. That's at 12% and you're running right around that now but what we were trying to say earlier is we don't look at 12% as being ""Gee, we made it. Now let's stop."" The answer is we'll drive that number as high as we can, driving responsible growth, and as we start to get rid of more of equity, then we earn because we have access to equity that'll help. We can continue to improve the earnings that'll help us drive operating leverage and all the things you cited will help.So, we're going to do it on a sustainable basis. So, the point was when we talked about those targets, we were probably running around 8% or something like that. And so, we said we had to pass over a couple of years to get as close to 12% and 1% ROA at the time and we've made it there and it'd be easier by tax reform but that doesn't mean we're stopping. We will just drive this company the same way and it'll come out be higher now and we'll see those levels and expect to continue to exceed.Saul Martinez --UBS -- AnalystOK, fair enough. I guess just to follow up and it's, I guess, maybe a little bit more of a philosophical question. So, Larry [Inaudible], as you know, sent a letter indicating that management should look not only at maximizing profitability and returns for shareholders but at the social impact of their actions, and I think for good reasons you guys take pride in being a good corporate citizen but I'm curious if you have any thoughts on that and whether you think there is a trade-off between maximizing profitability and doing good for society and other stakeholders? And with the tax windfall, do you feel like maybe there will be greater pressure to invest in things or to provide products or take actions that you may not have taken if tax reform hadn't happened?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI don't think it'll change the way we run the company. We've been running it on a responsible growth with the four elements: that it grow, no excuses; that it do it on a customer-focused organic basis; gotta do with the right risk; and gotta be sustainable, along the best place for people to work, share our success with our communities and drive the operational excellence. That format won't change. So, what Larry wrote about and what we've been working on for years, the idea of ESG and those types of things as part of our sustainable, part of our sharing success with communities.This is not new for banking. I mean, it goes back to -- Our banks, all those legacy banks that came together, all were formed to help communities grow. So, we had a long history in investing because we're if already successful, the economies in the communities, we do business in are successful. So, I don't think it's a major change in our industry, frankly, $200 million charitable giving, 2 million volunteer hours, billions of dollars of low and moderate housing [Inaudible] earnings, $1 billion plus out to the CDFIs.We can rattle off all the stuff, $100 million [Inaudible] commitment we're halfway through. These are things we were doing long before tax reform came and we'll do when tax reform goes away some day or something else changes. These are things that make this company great and, as you said, it's a philosophical viewpoint but also the public role of banking is just a little bit different.Saul Martinez --UBS -- AnalystOK, great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate the answers.OperatorAnd we can take our next question from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Your line is now open.Marty Mosby --Vining Sparks -- AnalystThank you. Wanted to drill into the expenses just a little bit to get some clarity. It seems like there was two, kind of, not unusual but kind of standout -- $200 million worth of compensation that would have been in the first quarter now's accelerated into the fourth quarter. And then, Brian, you were talking to $200 million of the charitable foundation and the extra bonus payments.Just want to make sure those were two separate items and that those numbers were correct.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMarty, I think we've got a little confused. So, in the fourth quarter in the $13.3 billion of expenses, there's about $145 million, $150 million of a one-time $1,000 bonus to people under $150,000 in our company plus we accelerated $50 million of charitable donations in the fourth quarter '17. That's the $200 million. That's what we're talking about.So, the $13.3 becomes $13.1 if you back up those two items and then do the math, multiply it times four. The acceleration, I assume what you're talking about there is change to FAS123 which is that, a simple way to think of it, if we used to take a billion in the first quarter, now we take 250 per quarter, it moves around a little bit that's a phenomenon we announced earlier this quarter, last quarter we're going to take. So, that number is in that $13.3 also, the 250 for that. It's not acceleration.It used to be done all at once in one quarter. Now, we spread it across four quarters.Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWe made that change in the fourth quarter. So, you're seeing it in the fourth-quarter numbers.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAnd the earlier number's been restated, so the relative difference year over year is the same. Does that help, Marty? Make sure I got your question --Marty Mosby --Vining Sparks -- Analyst[Inaudible] make sure those were two separate items and that reconciles where I was getting. And then, if you look at the securities portfolio, you had two things kind of popped up. One, you took just a very modest or slight loss in security sales. Also your ALCI, you had that OCI adjustment, those rates went higher that you mentioned earlier.Will you be actively restructuring because it does kind of drop to capital anyway in taking those losses as you have the opportunity to kind of round up earnings? Just curious how aggressive you wanted to be kind of in that push.Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThe short answer is no, we're not in any way restructuring our securities portfolio. There was a very modest -- nice find, there -- $23 million loss on some securities we sold in the fourth quarter. That was basically just some legacy stuff we got to a nice price, that affects our CCAR results and we wanted to get rid of it, so we think that's a good trade-off.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerIt wasn't related, Marty, to the core sort of way we invest the excess deposit proceeds in a given quarter. This is legacy stuff we're just trying to clean out.Marty Mosby --Vining Sparks -- AnalystOne of the things we're anticipating is that banks can actually accelerate the benefit as we do get uptick on the back end of the curve by doing some of that aggressive restructuring. So, just was curious if you have been kind of thinking about or kind of looking in that direction.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe feel look really good where we are in terms of our securities portfolio.Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerAnd, Marty, always remember the reason why we have the securities portfolio is because we have that deposit franchise growing $40 billion to $50 billion year over year, loans growth at a more modest rate specially due to the run-off. So, you just have to put the money to work and we put it into an investment portfolio to extract that value of that great deposit franchise.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYea, remember we're only putting them in treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, or cash. We have a very high-quality securities portfolio.Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerOperator, do we have another question?OperatorCertainly. We'll move to the next question. It comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open.Gerard Cassidy --RBC -- AnalystThank you. Hi, Brian.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMorning, Gerard. How are you?Gerard Cassidy --RBC -- AnalystGood, thank you. Your fourth-quarter results were good and the outlook looks quite good for you folks as well as your peers. Can you share with us what risks you're kind of looking out for on the horizon? Obviously, again, things are looking very good for you folks and we always have to watch out from left field for some type of risk. Anything that you can identify that you guys are just keeping an eye on?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYea, I think, Gerard, obviously we're afraid of horribles that you can go through whether it's geopolitical risk, whether it's markets, changing risk, whether it's credit risk because unemployment levels rise. They're all going to come back. This economy's gonna keep moving along, even accelerate or decline and we don't see a lot of risk in that but we do watch those risks. How we avoid them is not what we're doing today.In fact, it's what we've been doing over years to stay in a high prime quality and consumer business, balancing the consumer business versus commercial exposure, maintain our tough discipline in commercial credit and the situation this quarter obviously is always a wakeup call that some things don't turn out well, and we gotta back, and what are the lessons learned and what we did we do right or wrong in that and how do we avoid that in the future. And the team has spent significant time doing that. We weren't happy with it from the top of the house through to the actual people who were involved in it but even with that, the credit cards year over year were relatively flat and the team's going to adjust. So, when we think about all those risks and [Inaudible], you know the list as well as I do.The question is how do you balance and how do you keep yourself ahead of those so that you won't be immune from them but they will impact our company. That is what we define as responsible growth, quite frankly.Gerard Cassidy --RBC -- AnalystOK, thank you. And then you guys mentioned that your commercial customers were optimistic about the future. Can you share with us in the investment bank what the pipeline looks like at the end of the fourth quarter coming into '18? And then second, within the investment banking division, I think you mentioned you hired 400 bankers, what sectors are you really doing well and is it healthcare, technology, financial?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThose bankers are in the commercial banking segment. So, they're middle market and [Inaudible] bank, just to be clear. They are successful but they're across all industries. Paul, why don't you talk about --Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSure. The investment banking pipeline, end of the year, lower than Q3, mainly due to the completion of some large transactions in Q4 combined with the postponement or cancellation of some other large transactions. Having said that, again, I think we're very optimistic about 2018 given the tax act which, again, has leveled the playing field here. And we think companies are going to be interested in more M&A transactions and ultimately they're going to be investing and raising capital.So, down a little bit but that's kind of normal for cleanup at the year-end. Your other question regarding sector, we're No. 3 globally and when you look across all of our entity groups, we are plus or minus around that range pretty consistently. We obviously have a couple of groups that are strong than others but we feel like there are no weak spots in investment banking and all the groups are very strong.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerGerard, one thing I thought you were going to go to was what do consumers feel. It was interesting that the spending for the full-year '17 whether it's credit cards, debit cards, ACH, wires, payment of bills, cash out of ATMs, over the teller line, checks written, was as 6% growth over '16 and '16 to '15 was a little under 3%. So the consumers are feeling pretty good and spending very strongly out there and it is broader than just the credit and debit card spending. That is up 6% to 7%, as Paul said earlier, but it's the broader use of cash which shows that consumers are putting money out there and spending on things.So, we feel good about the consumer side and the month of December was faster than the year in terms of the growth rate of 7% versus 6%.Gerard Cassidy --RBC -- AnalystThat's a real good insight. And then just lastly, I think you talked about getting the dividend-payout ratio to 30% and I recognized that this is a board of directors' decision. If the regulators give the green light to the [Inaudible] banks that 40% dividend payout ratios are OK, philosophically, how do you think about that if, again, the green light is given by the regulators?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI think we'll have to think about that when we get there. I'm not sure for [Inaudible] largest banks are not going to always be a little more circumspect or whatever the right word would be in terms of governing our dividend. They just don't want us to ever have to cut our dividends and as you do, look at it mathematically across time periods. The idea of us [Inaudible] 70% of our earnings, therefore being able to pay for the dividend is a very low probability and that's where they came up with that number and I think we'll see how it plays out.I don't know what they'll do but our strategy inside the company is to continue to move up the dividend on a rational basis along with the earnings and get it close to that number.Gerard Cassidy --RBC -- AnalystGreat, appreciate it. Thank you again.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Your line is open.Vivek Juneja --JP Morgan -- AnalystHi. I have a couple of questions for you folks. Paul, you've mentioned that NII, you did some puts and takes. Just want to tie them all together.Net-net, I recognize that they can't issue in Q1, would you expect some growth going from Q4 to Q1 given the December rate hike even adjusting for the [Inaudible]?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI think it's too early to give you that sort of guidance. I've given you everything that I want to give you at this point. Again, we got two fewer days, we've got the card loans, which is usually a bit lower. You have to get rid of the FTE, I don't know how you look at it.And remember that at the end of Q4 there was a run-up in LIBOR in anticipation of the rate increase. So, we got some of that benefit in Q4. It's really just going to depend on loan and deposit growth and what happens on deposit pricing. That's why I'm not really willing to tell you higher or lower because I just don't know how deposit pricing's going to play out over the quarter.Vivek Juneja --JP Morgan -- AnalystOK, thanks on that one. Brian, a question for you. One of your peers set a goal of 2% of net income for corporate philanthropy. Are you thinking of setting anything like that?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe have what you call [Inaudible] charity. We've kept our levels consistent from before the crisis now about $175 million to $200 million a year as we expect to keep it there. In addition to that, we do tremendous volunteer work 2 million hours a year and other things. We feel comfortable at that level.I haven't even done the math lately, but I think that's 1% after-tax at this point but our view is that we can have a lot of impact there and it ebbs and flows depending on what's going on at the moment but I don't expect this to change dramatically.Vivek Juneja --JP Morgan -- AnalystOK, thank you.OperatorAnd we will take our final question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is open.Brian Kleinhanzl --KBW -- AnalystThanks. I know you don't want to give a commentary about deposit betas in the quarter and all that, but what's the ability that you have to remix [Inaudible] up to 125%, so to the extent that you don't want to get as competitive on deposit rates, I mean is there still plenty of opportunity to remix from short-term into loans?Paul Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerOn deposits, it's a very sophisticated question of how you price. We price literally by every market, by every product, by different customer sets. So, as Paul mentioned earlier, in the wealth-management business we moved pricing up because people with $10 million in investment assets with us, obviously the cash in their accounts is an investment asset as opposed to in the retail business, it'd be their household daily flow. So, it's a very sophisticated question and you're seeing us work that question across time and you saw us raise rates in the wealth-management business.Consumer business rates raised, albeit slower. The corporate business responds a little bit more instantaneously, but it's a methodology for paying for services. So, it's a very complex thing. So, it's hard to sort of give you a single answer and when we model, we use a number but frankly, we've done better than that model every single quarter but we have to be conservative on our modeling for NII and other purposes.Brian Kleinhanzl --KBW -- AnalystOK. And then just one follow-up on the expenses in 2019. I mean, is there a big opportunity to do investments? I know you said you would give further details later on as you looked across, maybe pull forward some investments and lower expenses, but it seems like if you were to go on some kind of accelerated investment, maybe there would be a chance to get below that $53 billion in expenses in 2019. I mean, that's a possibility, something you're actively pursuing?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOur job, what we told you guys, was when we get to $53 billion for '18, be relatively flat, thereon absorbing 6% medical care, cost increases, raises, and things like that, and that comes through ability to continue investment effectiveness and efficiency. So, that's an operating strategy level on the exact number that we're focused on and we continue to focus on that. So, there's no change to that. The question would be, do you want to accelerate some investments given the higher after-tax yield and we will look at it.As I said, we will look at it across time. You have to be able to get the value of those investments. As one of the callers' questions referenced a little bit earlier, we added 400 commercial bankers. We have to make sure if we added 400 more tomorrow, you might not be able to get them to speed.So, you have to make sure that coming in and use techniques to divide the portfolio to give them deeper client penetration to get the products per customer up. That takes time. You just can't snap your fingers. So, the ability to accelerate those investments are largely based on what we think we can do that will be modest in the sense that even if a fair increase at the margin is not a big number in the overall scheme of things at the $53 billion expense level.Any other day our challenge is to drive operating leverage and we continue to do that, we've done 12 quarters in a row and we will continue to do that going forward and that's good for our shareholders.Brian Kleinhanzl --KBW -- AnalystOK, thanks.OperatorThis does conclude the Q&A session.

A deeper look at the bank's latest earnings report shows that the bank continues to improve in terms of efficiency and profitability, so here are seven key items that are important for investors to know.First, the headline numbers. The bank's revenue of $22.2 billion handily beat estimates of $21.6 billion, and was up 7% from a year ago. Plus, the bank earned $0.41 per share, beating estimates by $0.06. This is certainly good news, as Bank of America's business continues to improve at a faster-than-expected pace. However, the headline numbers only tell a small part of the story, so let's take a closer look.Bank of America's stock has performed well over the past year -- will it continue? Image source: Getty Images (Note: This is not a chart of BofA's performance.)Bank of America's stock has traded for one of the lowest price-to-book multiples in the banking sector for several years. One major reason for this is the bank's lack of profitability -- specifically, the failure to meet the industry benchmarks of a 10% return on equity and a 1% return on assets. And while the bank isn't quite there yet, it's getting much closer.QuarterReturn on Assets (ROA)Return on Equity (ROE)1Q 20160.64%5.1%4Q 20160.85%7%1Q 20170.88%7.3%Data source: Bank of America earnings report.I mentioned earlier that Bank of America earned $0.41 per share for the first quarter. This was a 40% profit improvement over the first quarter of last year, much more of a jump than the bank's 7% revenue growth.The main reason for this is that while the bank's revenue grew, its expenses did not. Overall, Bank of America's expenses were completely flat year over year. Particularly impressive was the consumer banking unit, which managed to reduce expenses by 3%, despite a 5% growth in revenue. In a nutshell, increased revenue without higher expenses translates to strong profit growth.I've written beforeabout how Bank of America's capital priority over the past few years has been buying back its own shares, as opposed to aggressively increasing its dividend. And despite the much higher share price, that is still the case, as the bank returned $3.1 billion to shareholders during the quarter, and $2.3 billion of this was in the form of buybacks.Bank of America shares have risen considerably in price over the past year or so, and now trade for just under their book value, and therefore are not as compelling of a bargain as they used to be. Buybacks may be the priority for the time being, but I wouldn't be surprised to see the emphasis shift slightly, in favor of a higher dividend, once the bank submits its capital plan to the Federal Reserve.One factor that has kept Bank of America's profitability low over the past few years, as well as the rest of the banking industry, has been record low interest spreads. Banks earn a profit from borrowing money at a low rate, and lending it to customers at a higher rate -- known as the ""spread,"" or the net interest yield.During the first quarter, Bank of America's net interest yield finally started to improve after three straight quarters stuck at the lows. In the earnings report, Bank of America says it expects this to increase further in the second quarter, even without any additional interest rate hikes. Furthermore, the bank says that a 100 basis point (1%) improvement in the yield curve would translate to an additional $3.3 billion in net interest income over the next 12 months.Image source: Getty Images.A bank's efficiency ratio is a measurement of how much the bank spends to generate its earnings, so lower is better. Bank of America's efficiency ratio has improved by 450 basis points over the past year, but 67% is still on the high end.However, Bank of America pointed out in its earnings presentation that this looks artificially high due to seasonality. Specifically, if certain expenses, such as seasonally elevated payroll tax costs, had been spread evenly throughout the year, the efficiency ratio would have been a much more attractive 62%.Part of the reason for Bank of America's increasing efficiency is its strong growth in mobile and online banking. The more people who use these platforms, the greater the cost savings. For example, it costs the bank far less to process a paper check that's deposited than it costs to process a mobile check deposit.During the first quarter, Bank of America reported 22.2 million active mobile banking users, a 13% year-over-year improvement. One-fifth of all deposit transactions are now completed through its mobile platform. Bank of America has received top rankings in mobile and online banking functionality, and also has improved its digital sales capability in recent quarters.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The answer is: Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) .Shares of the nation's second-biggest bank by assets are up 21% since the beginning of the year. That handily outperforms the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen blue-chip bank stocks and is up 8% year to date.Image source: Getty Images.Bank of America's stock has been propelled by four factors, the most significant of which was last year's presidential election. The surprise outcome sent bank stocks up across the board, as investors wagered that the then-president-elect would follow through on his campaign vow to ""dismantle"" the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010and lower the corporate tax rate.Both of these would bolster banks' bottom lines. Easing the regulatory burden would free banks to reduce their compliance costs, which have climbed significantly since the financial crisis. This would translate into more net income. Meanwhile, a lower tax rate would allow banks to keep more of that income for their shareholders as opposed to remitting it to the government.BACdata by YCharts.The second factor that has pushed Bank of America's shares up this year are higher interest rates. As a general rule, banks make more money when interest rates are high rather than when they're low. In Bank of America's latest quarterly report with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank discloses that a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates will translate into $3.2 billion more net interest income -- i.e., revenue from loans and other interest-earning assets less funding costs.Interest rates are still low right now, with the fed funds rateat between 1% and 1.25%, but they're on the way up. Since this time last year, the Federal Reserve has raised the fed funds rate three times, in December, March, and June. The impact from this was apparent in Bank of America's latest quarterly earnings, which showed that the bank's net interest income rose $960 million, or 9.4%, compared to the year-ago period.The third factor at play in Bank of America's stock performance this year has been its low valuation, which gives shares of the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank more upside than banks that already trade at high valuations. Twelve months ago, Bank of America's stock traded for a nearly 30% discount to book value. Today, it trades for a 12% premium.Fueling this rally is the fourth factor: Bank of America's improving fundamental performance. It has slashed expenses relentlessly, most recently as part of a still-ongoing effort announced in 2016 to reduce its annual operating expenses $3 billionby next year. The impact of this and other expense initiatives can be seen on Bank of America's efficiency ratio, the percent of revenue spent on operating expenses, which has dipped below 60%for two consecutive quarters.The net result is that Bank of America has seen its profitability climb to within reach of the bank's own stated goal of generating a 1% return on assets -- net income as a percent of total assets. It came in just under that in the latest quarter, reporting a 0.98% return on assets. Bank of America still has ground to cover, in other words, but that amounted to an improvement over the same quarter last year, when it reported a 0.90% return on assets.In sum, if you're wondering why Bank of America's stock is up so far this year, these four factors go a long way toward providing an answer. And the best part yet is that all four of them continue to move in Bank of America's favor, providing an auspicious sign for the future.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

I'll spell out exactly how I intend to approach this, after laying out my thesis.In the immediate aftermath of the presidential election, shares of banks rocketed. And none more so than Bank of America.BACdata by YCharts.They rocketed because investors believed that a pro-business president would be good for the economy, which would boost loan demand and interest rates. This would position banks to sell more of their primary product, and do so at a higher price.On the campaign trail, moreover, the current president vowed to ""dismantle"" the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which had been passed to combat the conduct that led to the financial crisis. The regulations passed under Dodd-Frank have become incredibly burdensome to any objective observer.When a banker with pristine credentials such as Robert Wilmers at M&T Bankspends the lion's share of his widely read annual letter every year talking about the undue compliance burden facing banks, and is seconded by the likes of U.S. Bancorp's Richard Davis and JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, the fact is that the regulatory environment has gotten too onerous.So there were good reasons that the market responded.But the market went too far. Valuations got too far out in front of fundamental performances. This is why I wrote in February that cash will be king in 2017, as it wouldn't be a surprise to see valuations correct sometime this year after the messy realities of governing sunk in.Some people will see this as market timing, the implication being that it's impossible to time the market. But one should never get dogmatic in their thinking.The reality is that stocks, measured by the leading stock market valuation measure today, Robert Shiller's CAPE ratio, have only been higher twice in history: In 1929 and 1999.One reason stocks are historically high is that interest rates are historically low -- Warren Buffett makes this point. And interest rates and stocks are inversely correlated. As rates go up, so too will the required rate of return on stocks in order to compete on a risk-adjusted basis with risk-free alternatives such as government bonds.But interest rates were priced into stocks before the election. What happened after the election, with bank stocks rallying 20% or more, was all about expectations around Donald Trump's ability to deliver on his promise to lower taxes, ease regulations, and boost economic growth.That wasn't a bad bet, given the Republican unity between the executive and legislative branches. Fast-forward to today, however, and the governing agenda has taken a back seat to the controversies swirling around the president.It seems increasingly unlikely, if not fanciful, to think that any type of meaningful tax reform can be accomplished at this point. Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell went on the record this week to say that tax reform must be revenue neutral, which effectively eliminates the simulative impact from the proposed reform and will temper any cuts to the corporate income-tax rate.The same goes for the other legislative priorities the administration had laid out. Things like repealing Obamacare, building a wall, investing $1 trillion in domestic infrastructure, and so on.The net result is that expectations are being recast. As that happens, it would make logical sense that stock valuations will follow. And as that happens, it's my opinion that there will be attractive investments to be made.One of those investments is Bank of America.The nation's second biggest bank by assets is no longer weighed down by legal actions and toxic assets tracing back to the financial crisis. As a result, while Bank of America has spent $200 billionover the past eight years on crisis-related costs, it's now free to grow revenue and earnings consistently.And growing earnings is exactly what it's doing. Last year was the second best year in Bank of America's history, in terms of the size of its bottom line. By the end of this year, moreover, Bank of America could be on trackto meet its profitability targets on an annualized basis.On top of that, Bank of America has an abundance of excess capital on its balance sheet. I estimate that it could return as much as $23 billionto shareholders by way of buybacks, yet still be considered well capitalized and sail through the quantitative portion of the annual stress tests.And the bank's chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan, has repeatedly saidthat buying back a lot of stock is one of his top priorities. He did so most recently in his 2016 shareholder letter.Eventually, it will be freed up to do just that. And it'll probably be sooner rather than later. By next year, Bank of America could have a combined payout ratio of more than 100%, meaning that it pays out more in dividends and buybacks than it earns in net income.This would drive down the capital on its balance sheet, and thereby drive up its profitability. And because profitability and valuation are intimately intertwined, it would boost Bank of America's valuation, a move that would be catalyzed by the bank's falling share count.It would also increase the buying pressure on Bank of America's stock. This would come from both the bank's repurchase program, as well as from income investors that move back into its stock for the growing dividend.Consequently, the threshold I'm looking for is around $20 a share. If Bank of America's stock breaks below that, I'll start buying it. I'll do so in multiple stages, which will allow me to average around the bottom.That's my plan. I think it's a good one.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This situation has weighed on its performance for much of the past few years, but things are starting to turn in the North Carolina-based bank's favor.Since December 2015, the Federal Reserve has increased the fed funds ratethree times, for a total of 75 basis points, or 0.75%. The second increase, which occurred in the final month of last year, boosted Bank of America's net interest income by just under $600 million a quarter, which is exactly what the bank had promised.Image source: The Motley Fool.This was one of the two principal reasons Bank of America's earnings surged 44%in the first quarter compared with the year-ago period. The other reason being a sharp year-over-year gain in the amount of money its trading and investment banking operations generated.The good news for shareholders is that there's still more gas in the tank insofar as interest rates are concerned. Rates remain abnormally low. The fed funds rate, which is the primary short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, has stayed below 1% since the start of 2009. To reach its long-run average, it'll take 20 or so more increases like the one in December 2016.Effective Federal Funds Ratedata by YCharts.Bank of America's shareholders won't have to wait long to see another uptick in net interest income from higher rates. The Fed's decision to raise rates last month would have had a nominal impact on its first-quarter earnings, but it should shine through in the second quarter.To this end, Bank of America estimates that the latest interest-rate increase will translate into an additional $150 million in net interest income a quarter going forward. Holding all else equal, that equates to $600 million on an annual basis, or roughly $0.06 per share in pre-tax earnings.Where's that number come from? Here's Bank of America's chief financial officer, Paul Donofrio, on the bank's quarterly conference call from earlier this week (emphasis added):As of 3/31, an instantaneous 100 basis point parallel increase in rates is estimated to increase [net interest income] by $3.3 billion over the subsequent 12 months, which is consistent with our position at year end. Nearly three-quarters or $2.5 billion of this modeling is driven by our sensitivity to short-end rates. Given a one-month LIBOR rise of about 25 basis points with the March hike and the long end down, we should focus on the $2.5 billion short-end benefit. Dividing that by 4 gets you a quarterly run rate of roughly $600 million for a 100-basis-point shock. Assuming it's only 25 basis points instead of 100 would get you to approximately $150 million benefit in the quarter.In sum, so long as interest rates continue heading higher, Bank of America can look forward to steadily expanding top and bottom lines. This doesn't necessarily mean its stock a buy right now, as valuations in the industry have gotten ahead of fundamentals over the past few months. But it does mean existing shareholders have plenty to look forward to.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If this happened, Moynihan believes that more buyers would be able to obtain affordable mortgages, and banks would benefit from the added business, a win-win.The majority of U.S. mortgages are underwritten to strict standards set by government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Maeand Freddie Mac. And one long-standing provision of these standards is a down payment requirement of 20%.Image source: Getty Images.When speaking about potential regulatory reforms, Moynihan said, ""Our goal - going back to regulatory reform - is should you move the down payment requirement from 20 percent to 10?"" He went on to say that doing so could have a big, positive impact on the U.S. mortgage industry. ""It wouldn't introduce that much risk, but would actually help a lot of mortgages get done.""To be perfectly clear, it's already quite possible to obtain a conventional mortgage without putting 20% down. In fact, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac both have programs designed to approve borrowers with down payments of as little as 3%.However, any down payment below the current standard of 20% on a conventional mortgage adds the additional expense of private mortgage insurance (PMI). While this would conceivably still apply to loans with less than 10% down, if the standard down payment were lowered to 10%, it would make it easier for potential borrowers to avoid PMI without having to save up nearly as much cash.Here's an example of how much of a difference this can make in terms of home affordability:Let's say that you want to buy a house for $300,000, but don't have $60,000 sitting in your savings account for a 20% down payment. However, you can reasonably come up with $30,000, so you apply for a 30-year conventional mortgage anyway.Based on a 4% interest rate, this would produce a monthly payment of $1,289 (principal and interest). In addition, because you put less than 20% down, you'll also pay $133 per month for PMI, based on the current national averages. In other words, the result of the lower down payment is an increase of more than 10% on your monthly mortgage payment.An additional $133 may not sound like too much, but since it must be paid until the loan-to-value falls below 80%, this means that over the course of your mortgage, you'll pay $8,911 more than you would have without PMI.Anytime the down payment standards for mortgages are relaxed, it immediately conjures up fears that the mortgage crisis will repeat itself. It's certainly understandable why people would feel that way -- after all, easy access to mortgages with little or no money down was a major contributing factor to the mortgage meltdown.However, it's important to point out one bigdifference. Lending standards have gotten much higher than their pre-crisis levels, and as long as that stays the same, there's no reason to worry about another foreclosure epidemic.To illustrate this, consider that as of April 2017, the average FICO credit score for an approved conventional purchase mortgage was 753, which is generally considered to be very good credit. Employment, assets, and income are now thoroughly verified, as anyone who has applied for a mortgage within the past eight years or so can tell you. Also, mortgage lenders tend to hold lower down payment borrowers to somewhat higher standards.The point is, as long as lenders such as Bank of America are maintaining high credit standards and thorough verification practices, a lower down payment won't necessarily translate into an uptick in the loan default rate.The bottom line is that lowering the down payment requirement to 10% would make homeownership more affordable to many Americans, could be a positive catalyst to the housing market, and would provide a boost to the mortgage lending business of Bank of America and other mortgage originators.While there is still some due diligence that would need to happen in order to responsibly relax the down payment requirement as Moynihan suggests, this could turn into a big win for would-be homebuyers and bank investors alike.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

With that deal, which helped to buttress Bank of America's fortunes at the nadir or its post- financial crisistroubles, Berkshire acquired warrants to buy the shares for $7.14 each.Warren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Image source: The Motley Fool.Berkshire executed the purchase not by injecting new funds into Bank of America, but rather by converting its existing $5 billion worth of preferred stock. Buffett had telegraphed that he would do so earlier this year in his latest letter to shareholders:[Bank of America's preferred] stock, which pays us $300 million per year, also carries with it a valuable warrant allowing Berkshire to purchase 700 million common shares of Bank of America for $5 billion at any time before September 2, 2021. At yearend, that privilege would have delivered us a profit of $10.5 billion. If it wishes, Berkshire can use its preferred shares to satisfy the $5 billion cost of exercising the warrant.If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock -- now 30 cents annually -- should rise above 44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common. If the common dividend remains below 44 cents, it is highly probable that we will exercise the warrant immediately before it expires.It was Bank of America's decision in June to raise its dividendthat accordingly prompted Berkshire Hathaway to convert its preferred stock into common stock. Prior to that, Bank of America paid $0.075 per share in dividends each quarter. Following the hike, it pays $0.12 per share.""In 2011, we welcomed Berkshire Hathaway as a shareholder, and we appreciate their continued support now as our largest common shareholder,"" said Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan.Bank of America chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America.Beyond this news, Buffett also gave an interviewto CNBC's Becky Quick in which he talked about Bank of America, saying:It will be a long, long time before we sell a share of Bank of America. I'm very happy. We have 700 million shares. I like the business. I like the valuation. And I like the management very much. So I think you see that for a long time in our holdings.This is great news for Bank of America. Buffett is the most revered bank investor in the United States, having accumulated major ownership stakes in many of the nation's leading banks for Berkshire Hathaway. Consequently, having him as the bank's biggest shareholder gives Bank of America an important and valuable seal of approval.And, of course, Buffett didn't do too bad either. All told, Berkshire has made about $13 billion in profit from its investment in the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The bank has been chipping away at this with modestly sized buyback programs over the last few years, but on Wednesday, it doubled down by announcinga significant increase to its current repurchase authorization.Bank of America's board has authorized the repurchase of $12 billion worth of common stock over the next 12 months. That's more than double the $5 billion buyback program it approved last year. Bank of America also raised its quarterly dividend by 60% to $0.12 a share, up from $0.075 per share.YearBank of America's Authorized Buybacks2013$5 billion2014$4 billion2015$4 billion2016$5 billion2017$12 billionData source: Bank of America.Bank of America's moves come on the heels of the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR. This is the second stage in the annual stress tests that are used to assess whether that nation's biggest banks have enough capital to survive an economic downturn similar to the financial crisis. The results from the first stage -- known as the Dodd-Frank Actstress tests, or DFAST -- were released last week.All 34 of the banks that took the CCAR this year passed, the Federal Reserve announcedon Wednesday, though Capital One Financialmust submit a new capital plan within six months that addresses weaknesses in its capital planning process.Brian Moynihan, the Chairman and CEO of Bank of America. Image source: Bank of America.For its part, Bank of America passed with flying colors. To satisfy regulators, a bank must maintain a sufficient amount of high-quality, highly liquid capital through a nine-quarter horizon that assumes, among other things, that the unemployment rate shoots up to 10%, gross domestic product falls by more than 6%, and that real estate prices drop by a quarter to a third, depending on whether it's residential or commercial property.The benchmark is a common equity tier 1 capital ratio, or CET1 ratio, of 4.5%. Going into the test, Bank of America's CET1 ratio was nearly three times that, at 12.1%. That fell to 8.9% at the low point of DFAST, the first round of the stress tests. And then after factoring in Bank of America's planned capital raise, it declined to 6.8% at the low point of the CCAR analysis. That's a big drop, but it still comfortably exceeds the 4.5% regulatory minimum.Stage in 2017 Stress TestsBank of America's CET1 RatioGoing into test12.1%DFAST low point8.9%CCAR low point6.8%Data source: Federal Reserve.The net result for Bank of America's shareholders is that the nation's second biggest bank by assets is now in a position to start delivering in a meaningful way on Moynihan's early vow to reduce the bank's outstanding share count, and thereby reverse some of the damage done to shareholder value during the crisis.This year's $12 billion repurchase authorization positions Bank of America to repurchase 5% of its outstanding share count.

Yet, bank stocks nevertheless dropped in the wake of the news, with Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) off by 1.6%.The Fed's decision to raise the benchmark fed funds rate, the rate banks charge to lend each other excess cash, marked the third time this year that it had done so. The target fed funds rate is now between 1.25% and 1.5%.""Information received since the Federal Open Market Committee met in November indicates that the labor market has continued to strengthen and that economic activity has been rising at a solid rate,"" noted a press releaseannouncing the interest rate hike. The release continued: ""Averaging through hurricane-related fluctuations, job gains have been solid, and the unemployment rate declined further. Household spending has been expanding at a moderate rate, and growth in business fixed investment has picked up in recent quarters.""Image source: Getty Images.Despite the fact that Bank of America's stock dropped today, the Fed's move is good news for the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank. In the first case, a healthy economy translates into more demand for loans, as well as lower loan losses. Moreover, because interest rates reflect the price of money, when they go up, banks generate more revenue from selling money -- i.e., making loans.You can get a sense for how much higher rates will help Bank of Americafrom its quarterly regulatory filings. Its latest interest rate sensitivity analysis shows that a 100-basis-point, or 1-percentage-point, increase in both short- and long-term rates will translate into an additional $3.2 billion worth of net interest income.The impact isn't as potent if only one side of the yield curve increases. If just short-term rates increase 100 basis points, then Bank of America will earn an extra $2.2 billion. Meanwhile, if only long-term rates rise 100 basis points, then the added revenue comes out to a little more than $1 billion.Bank of America's interest rate sensitivity analysis. Image source: Bank of America.It's important to appreciate that the Federal Reserve isn't going to raise interest rates that much in one fell swoop. In every increase since the financial crisis, the Fed has ratcheted up rates in increments of 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage points. But Bank of America's interest rate sensitivity analysis nevertheless illustrates, directionally, why higher rates are good for banks.The Fed's move caps off a good year for shareholders of Bank of America. Its stock is up 31% since the beginning of 2017. That compares to a 16% increase on the KBW Bank Index, which tracks shares of two dozen large-cap bank stocks, including Bank of America. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 is up 19% over the same stretch.It's impossible to say whether Bank of America will continue to beat the market next year, but if rates head higher, both its profitability and efficiency will further improve. Over the long run, this should bolster the $2.2 trillion bank's valuation, which could indeed fuel a continuation of this year's rally.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In its latest quarterly financial filing, Bank of America disclosed that a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates should translate into an additional $3.3 billionin added quarterly net interest income.Bank of America Chairman and CEO, Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America.The problem, though, was that both short- and long-term rates didn't go up today. Short-term rates did, thanks to the Fed's decision to increase the Fed funds rateby 25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage points. But long-term rates fell, as the yield on the 10-year Treasury bonds declined from 2.21% at open down to 2.14% at market close.The net result was that, at least insofar as interest rates are concerned, today was a mixed bag for Bank of America. There was good news, but it was accompanied by bad news.US Target Federal Funds Ratedata by YCharts.It's hard to say exactly why long-term interest rates dropped, but there are two likely culprits. The first is that the latest inflation data, released Wednesday morning, shows that the rise in consumer prices is decelerating.Through the first three months of the year, core inflation (all consumer goods, less food and energy) came in at 2% or higher. This began to decelerate in April, when the figure fell to 1.9%. And it dropped further in May, down to 1.7%.This isn't a promising trend. It suggests that the economy isn't as robust as many had assumed, which could eventually weigh on the demand for loans, the principal product sold by banks. In addition, the rate of inflation is one of two primary variables the Fed weighs when making monetary policy decisions, the other being unemployment. As inflation drops, so too does the Fed's incentive to continue raising interest rates.Data source: U.S. Department of Labor. Chart by author.The second culprit was a reportfrom the Commerce Department on U.S. retail sales, a critical component of gross domestic product. Retail sales fell 0.3% in May compared to the prior month. This is bad in and of itself, but exacerbating the impact on the markets was the fact that analysts had expected the measure to increase 0.1% last month.Lower retail sales affect Bank of America in two ways. First, it means that consumers bought less, and thus likely used their debit and credit cards less. This reduces the interchange income Bank of America earns every time a person pays for something with a card issued by the bank.More important than this is what the decline in consumer purchasing activity may say about the direction of the economy. If the trend continues, the country could very well see itself enter a recession. That's still a long way out, but retail sales are a leading indicator of economic activity. And if a recession were to materialize, not only would Bank of America see loan demand wane, it would also experience an uptick in loan defaults, which would impair its bottom line.Thus, while it's certainly a positive thing that the Fed increased short-term rates for the second time this year, that wasn't enough to offset the otherwise negative impact on the market from lower-than-expected inflation and retail sales in May.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This is only the third time since the financial crisis that the nation's second biggest bank by assets has done so. Bank of America also said it will add $12 billion to its share repurchase authorization.Metric2017 CCAR2016 CCARDividend per share$0.075Stock buyback authority$5 billion*Bank of America expects to repurchase an additional $900 million worth of stock to offset equity-based compensation. Data source: Bank of America.Going into the stress tests, KBW projectedthat the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank would raise its dividend by 33%, from a current quarterly payout of $0.075 per share up to $0.10 per share. Bank of America was also expected to increase its share buybacks this year by roughly $4.5 billion, or 64%.Bank of America's success in the first round of this year's stress tests foreshadowed today's announcement. The results from the first round, referred to as the Dodd-Frank Actstress test, or DFAST, were publishedlast Thursday. They revealed that Bank of America has far more capital than it would need to survive a hypothetical economic downturn akin in severity to the 2008 crisis.Image source: Bank of America.The controlling threshold in DFAST is a common equity tier 1 capital ratio, or CET1 ratio, of 4.5%. So long as a bank exceeds this through the test's nine-quarter time horizon, it passes. If it doesn't, then it fails.In Bank of America's case, it wasn't even close. Going into the test, its CET1 ratio was 12.1%. While this dropped to 8.9% at the low point in this year's exercise, that still nearly doubled the regulatory minimum of 4.5%.The second round of the stress tests, known as the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR, takes this exercise one step further. It gives the Fed veto power over big bank capital plans -- whether to raise their dividends, and how much stock to buy back.As the Fed explains:When considering a firm's capital plan, the Federal Reserve considers both quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative factors include a firm's projected capital ratios under a hypothetical scenario of severe economic and financial market stress. Qualitative factors include the strength of the firm's capital planning process, which incorporate the risk management, internal controls, and governance practices that support the process. The Federal Reserve may object to a capital plan based on quantitative or qualitative concerns. If the Federal Reserve objects to a capital plan, a firm may not make any capital distribution unless expressly authorized by the Federal Reserve.Bank of America has run into problems on the CCAR in the past. Its request to increase its dividend in 2011 was denied. And while it was allowed to raise its dividend in 2014, it waited a full year before requesting another increase, not doing so again until in 2016. Meanwhile, many of its peers have raised their quarterly payouts annually since 2010.All told, Bank of America sailed through this year's CCAR. After factoring in its planned capital actions, its minimum CET1 ratio fell to 6.8%, still comfortably exceeding the 4.5% minimum.Expectations that Bank of America would pass this year's CCAR, and thereby accelerate its capital return program, caused its shares to close 2.6% higher on Wednesday, adding another 1.3% in after-hours trading.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

What's behind the decline? It's impossible to say for sure, but you'd be excused for thinking that the growing sense of uncertainty coursing through the markets is the culprit.Image source: Getty Images.Make no mistake about it, the past year has been more than kind to bank stocks. If you take a list of the 20 biggest banks in the country, their shares are up by an average of 33% over the past 12 months. Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) has led the way, with a 58% rally. Even the worst performing big-bank stocks have done pretty well, with Bank of New York Mellon's performance coming in last on the KBW Bank Index, but nevertheless up by 17%.The catalyst for the rally in bank stocks was the unexpected outcome of last year's presidential election. On the campaign trail, then-candidate Donald Trump promised to slash regulations and corporate taxes, both of which would free up banks to make more money. This is what sent shares of Bank of America and other banks up sharply in the days after the election.KBWBdata by YCharts.Since then, bank stocks have continued to move higher. Some of this can be attributed to good news about the economy, with the unemployment rate now at only 4.1%. Another source for optimism in the bank industry has been rising interest rates, which allow banks to earn more from their portfolios of loans and securities. To this end, the Federal Reserve has boosted the fed funds rate three times since this time last year.While all of this is good news, there's reason to believe that investors have gotten ahead of themselves when it comes to bank stocks. This is what we seem to be seeing now, as the sector has given back gains over the past week.Most importantly right now, it remains to be seen whether Congress will be able to cut corporate taxes. The majority party in the House of Representatives and the Senate are trying to do so now, but it's far from certain that they'll be able to get it done.""I remain concerned over how the current tax reform proposals will grow the already staggering national debt by opting for short-term fixes while ignoring long-term problems for taxpayers and the economy,"" saidSenator Jeff Flake on Thursday. ""We must achieve real tax reform crafted in a fiscally responsible manner. I look forward to working with my colleagues during a full and robust debate on the Senate floor to deliver on that goal.""""Pleased to see #TaxReform is moving through the regular order w/ hearings, markup, debate & amendments,"" tweeted Senator John McCain. ""I've long believed we need to fix our burdensome tax system & am reviewing the Senate bill to ensure it benefits the people of #Arizona.""Pleased to see #TaxReformis moving through the regular order w/ hearings, markup, debate & amendments. I've long believed we need to fix our burdensome tax system & am reviewing the Senate bill to ensure it benefits the people of #Arizona.These may seem supportive, but they imply that at least two Republican senators are worried about the national debt -- which, until recently, was a cornerstone of the Republican agenda. On top of this, McCain's point about regular order implies that at least some members of the caucus will require any tax plan to be scored by the Congressional Budget Office, which recently estimated that the tax plan submitted by the House of Representatives would add $1.7 trillion to the national debt over the next 10 years.All of this suggests that tax reform isn't going to be as easy as one might think it would be with both the legislative and executive branches of government controlled by one party. Consequently, for bank stocks that were bid up in anticipation of tax reform, it's reasonable to see them retreat as it becomes clearer what a difficult task reforming the tax code may end up being.Add to this the uncertainty around recent events in the Middle East, with a growing conflict between a Saudi Arabian-backed group of states and an Iranian-backed group. And then there's North Korea and the pending Brexit in the United Kingdom, which will remove it from the European Union.In short, if you're wondering why bank stocks have retreated recently, the uncertainty caused by the current domestic and global political situations seems to be a good place to start to find an answer.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This is good news for Bank of America, because higher rates will translate intohigher net interest income, and thus higher earnings.BACdata by YCharts.To understand why rising rates boost revenue at Bank of America, it's helpful to analogize a bank's business model to that of a retail store -- say, a bookstore. Holding all else equal, if the price of books rises, so, too, will the bookstore's revenue. The same is true for banks, only instead of selling books, they sell money by making loans, with the price reflected in the interest rate.Some banks are more sensitive to higher rates than others, with Bank of America being especially "" asset sensitive."" The North Carolina-based bank's latest interest rate sensitivity analysis shows that a 100 basis point, or one percentage point, increase in short- and long-term rates would translate into $3.3 billion worth of additional net interest income.Thus, as yields rose on Monday on 10-Year Treasury bonds, the principal long-term interest rate benchmark in the United States, it was no surprise that bank stocks responded in kind, with Bank of America leading the way. An index that tracks two dozen large-cap bank stocks was up 2% at the close of trading, while shares of Bank of America finished the day 4% higher.Bank of America's corporate center towers of downtown Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: Getty Images.But while this explanation is accurate, it's also incomplete, because it glosses over the catalyst that caused long-term interest rates to climb. Namely, the results from first round of the presidential election on Sunday in France.There was concern that a strong showing by far-right candidate Marine Le Pen would spell trouble for the European Union, as she's campaigned on an anti-NATO and anti-EU platform. It's one thing if the United Kingdom leaves, as it never fully joined, eschewing the euro in favor of the pound, but France's departure would essentially cause the union's disintegration.That Le Pen was edged out by 39-year-old political novice Emmanuel Macron thus came as a relief to the markets, which would have abhorred the uncertainty of an otherwise seemingly doomed EU. Offering added relief was that the other leading presidential candidates then put their support in the upcoming run-off behind Macron.To tie this back to interest rates, then, because 10-Year Treasury bonds are considered to be among the safest investments in the world, it stands to reason that when risk goes down, so too will the price of bonds. And because a bond's price is inversely correlated to its yield, this explains why the yield on 10-Year Treasury bonds climbed today, thus igniting the rally in Bank of America's stock.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

There are two catalysts in particular that could cause shares of the nation's second biggest bank by assets to either advance or retreat.The first catalyst will arrive this week. On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee is meeting to decide whether to raise interest rates. It will announce the decision on Wednesday, and if it does in fact increase rates, as most people expect it to do, it will mark the second time this year that it's done so.The Fed's decision will boil down to two variables, the first being unemployment. Based on this alone, there's every reason to believe that the central bank will in fact hike the Fed funds rate, the primary short-term interest rate benchmark in the United States. The current unemployment rate of 4.3% is comfortably below the Fed's 5% target. This accordingly weighs in favor of a rate hike.US Unemployment Ratedata by YCharts.The second variable is inflation. This too seems to suggest that the Fed will raise rates, as the latest inflation data showed that consumer prices rose by 2.2% over the same month last year. This is above the Fed's 2% target, which suggests that higher interest rates may be appropriate to slow the advance of consumer prices.Bank of America would welcome such a move. In its latest quarterly regulatory filing, the bank noted that a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates will translate into $3.3 billionin additional net interest income over the following 12 months.The Fed isn't likely to raise rates that much this month -- a 25-basis-point boost is more likely -- but that's nevertheless a step in the right direction. To put it in perspective, when the Fed raised rates by 25 basis points in March, Bank of America said it would earn $150 million in added net interest income a quarter.The second catalyst that could impact Bank of America's stock is its performance on this year's Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review, or CCAR. This is the second step in the annual stress tests that the Fed uses to assess whether the nation's largest banks will be able to survive an economic downturn akin to the financial crisis.The CCAR is critical because it dictates whether a bank can increase its dividend and/or buy back more stock. Bank of America's performance on past stress tests, combined with its cautious approach to capital-return requests, has stymied that Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank's desire to raise its dividend in prior years. While competitors like Wells Fargoand JPMorgan Chasehave increased their quarterly payouts every year since 2010, Bank of America has done so only twice.Bank of America's headquarters in Charlotte, North Carolina. Image source: Getty Images.Anything is possible, but when the Fed releases CCAR results on June 30, there's every reason to believe it will allow Bank of America to raise both its dividend and allowance for stock buybacks. Not only is Bank of America more than adequately capitalized, it has also seen its earnings grow and become more consistentover the past few years, both of which weigh on the Fed's decision to approve or deny requests by banks to increase the amount of capital they return to shareholders.All of this is good news for Bank of America, but it doesn't necessarily mean you should buy its stock right now. Because these two catalysts are widely expected to occur, they're already likely baked into Bank of America's stock price. Additionally, the turmoil in the nation's capital, combined with the unfolding legislative paralysis in Congress, as well as the market's already lofty valuation, lead me to believe that investors have more to gain than to lose by waiting for a potential pullback before diving headlong into the market.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

""The amended complaint adequately pleads that defendants' concerted actions amounted to an unreasonable restraint on trade.""Michael Eisenkraft, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an email: ""We are pleased with the judge's ruling and look forward to prosecuting the case.""The banks have four weeks to formally answer the complaint by the Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System; California'sLos Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, Orange County Employees Retirement System and Sonoma County Employees' Retirement Association; and Torus Capital LLC.The case is Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System v.

Turkey believes he was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that.The investment summit in Riyadh typically attracts executives from some of the world's largest companies and media organizations. But it has rapidly become a vehicle for those firms to express their concerns over Khashoggi's disappearance.U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened ""severe punishment"" if it turns out Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, although he said Washington would be ""punishing"" itself if it halted military sales to Riyadh.Major news organizations such as CNN, the Financial Times, the New York Times, CNBC and Bloomberg have pulled out of the conference. The Fox Business Network, the lone Western news outlet still heading to the conference, told Reuters on Sunday it was reviewing that decision.Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, Viacom IncCEO Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, said they were no longer going.Goldman Sachs, Mastercard and Bank of America did not respond to requests on Sunday on whether they were still attending the event.Citigroup Incand Credit Suisse Group AGdeclined to comment on Sunday on their plans.Bill Winters, CEO of Asia, Africa and Middle East-focused bank Standard Chartered Plcwas still planning to go, the company said on Sunday.The absence of media and technology executives is likely to case a shadow over the three-day event, dubbed ""Davos in the Desert."" It has become the biggest show for investors to promote Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reform vision.""Whilst it is disappointing that some speakers and partners have pulled out, we are looking forward to welcoming thousands of speakers, moderators and guests from all over the world to Riyadh,"" a Future Investment Initiative representative said last week.","Stocks,BankingandLoans,Technology","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Mid-Day Update: Wall Street Roiled by Apple, Trade War Tensions, European Banking Woes', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/mid-day-update-wall-street-roiled-by-apple-trade-war-tensions-european-banking-woes-cm1054644', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9c7d8c6a722b5a65891bc'}}, {'news_title': 'Ionis Pharmaceuticals Collects Royalties -- and Spends It All', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/ionis-pharmaceuticals-collects-royalties-and-spends-it-all-cm1054612', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9c7d8c6a722b5a65891bd'}}, {'news_title': 'Tips for Investing in Australia', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tips-for-investing-in-australia-cm1054617', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9c7d8c6a722b5a65891be'}}]","{'$date': '2018-10-14T20:10:00Z'}"

It anticipates the Justice Department will seek unspecified monetary penalties stemming from mortgage securities which date back to 2006 and 2007.The lawsuit against UBS, a small originator of U.S. residential mortgages at the time, is among the last actions over misconduct in the sale and pooling of mortgage securities which helped to cause the financial crisis.In recent years, the Justice Department has settled similar claims with Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Credit Suisse Group AG, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Bank of America Corpand Barclays Plc.Barclays settled for $2 billion in March after resisting a penalty the U.S. government sought near the end of the Obama administration in 2016. Justice had sought a much higher fine at the time and, when the two sides could not come to terms, the department filed a lawsuit.More recently, HSBC Holdings Plcagreed to pay $765 million in October to settle with the Justice Department over its sale of defective mortgage securities before the crisis, while major player Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plcreached a $4.9 billion deal in May.After the crisis, banks were accused of deceiving investors about the quality of loans underlying the mortgage-backed securities they pooled and sold, with loans made to borrowers with no ability to repay them and based on inflated home appraisals.UBS, which originated $1.5 billion of U.S. residential mortgages in a $5 trillion market, lost more than $45 billion when the housing market collapsed, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,Economy,BankingandLoans,Technology","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Mid-Day Update: Wall Street Roiled by Apple, Trade War Tensions, European Banking Woes', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/mid-day-update-wall-street-roiled-by-apple-trade-war-tensions-european-banking-woes-cm1054644', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9cab4c6a722d0032ad380'}}, {'news_title': 'Ionis Pharmaceuticals Collects Royalties -- and Spends It All', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/ionis-pharmaceuticals-collects-royalties-and-spends-it-all-cm1054612', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9cab4c6a722d0032ad381'}}, {'news_title': 'Tips for Investing in Australia', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tips-for-investing-in-australia-cm1054617', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9cab4c6a722d0032ad382'}}]","{'$date': '2018-11-07T19:44:00Z'}"

He told attendees it is imperative that the unit changes its culture.Rankings detailed in Bank of America's financial reports show it slipping in a few areas over the past year, including high-yield corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities, but retaining its top position in investment-grade corporate debt, both in the United States and globally.Koder is taking over the business at year-end, following the planned departure of current investment banking chief Christian Meissner. He is one of more than two dozen senior bankers or executives in the division who have left since the beginning of 2017, according to a report by recruiting firm Sheffield Haworth cited in a recent Wall Street Journal article.Moynihan, Donofrio and Montag tried to assure senior Wall Street bankers that their business has the assets and talent to get back on track, and that doing better was a matter of using resources more effectively rather than changing strategy, one of the people said.One attendee told Reuters the messaging was encouraging, but said the business will not generate better performance until management and culture improves.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,BankingandLoans,Politics","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Mid-Day Update: Wall Street Roiled by Apple, Trade War Tensions, European Banking Woes', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/mid-day-update-wall-street-roiled-by-apple-trade-war-tensions-european-banking-woes-cm1054644', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9ca34c6a722d0032abd69'}}, {'news_title': 'Ionis Pharmaceuticals Collects Royalties -- and Spends It All', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/ionis-pharmaceuticals-collects-royalties-and-spends-it-all-cm1054612', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9ca34c6a722d0032abd6a'}}, {'news_title': 'Tips for Investing in Australia', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tips-for-investing-in-australia-cm1054617', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9ca34c6a722d0032abd6b'}}]","{'$date': '2018-10-24T18:10:00Z'}"

In early trading, the benchmark S&P 500's e-mini futures contractwas off by about a quarter of a percent.The Treasury said in a statement that Mnuchin talked with the chief executives of Bank of America, Citi, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanleyand Wells Fargo.""The CEOs confirmed that they have ample liquidity available for lending,"" the Treasury said.Mnuchin ""also confirmed that they have not experienced any clearance or margin issues and that the markets continue to function properly,"" the Treasury said.Mnuchin's calls to the bankers came amid a partial government shutdown that began on Saturday following an impasse in Congress over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico. Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs expired at midnight on Friday and the shutdown could continue to Jan. 3.The Treasury said Mnuchin will convene a call on Monday with the president's Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes Washington's main stewards of the U.S. financial system and is sometimes referred to as the ""Plunge Protection Team.""The group, which was also convened in 2009 during the latter stage of the financial crisis, includes officials from the Federal Reserve as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission.Wall Street is also closely following reports that Trump has privately discussed the possibility of firing Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. Mnuchin said on Saturday Trump told him he had ""never suggested firing"" Powell.Trump has criticized the U.S. central bank for raising interest rates this year, which could further dampen economic growth. The Fed's independence is seen as a pillar of the U.S. financial system.Mnuchin's calls come as a range of asset classes have suffered steep losses.In December alone, the S&P 500is down nearly 12.5 percent, while the Nasdaq Compositehas slumped 13.6 percent.

It would preserve about 425 stores that Sears has yet to close, and secure the jobs of up to 50,000 workers out of the 68,000 employed by the retailer. An affiliate of ESL, Transform Holdco LLC, submitted the bid, the spokesman said.Some of Lampert's bid relies on $1.8 billion of Sears debt that ESL already holds and plans to forgive to back the offer, the sources said. The bid also includes about $400 million in financing from non-bank lenders, the sources said.The bid contemplates assuming protection agreements Sears has previously sold to reassure customers who have bought appliances, televisions, lawn tractors and other big-ticket items, the ESL spokesman said.""Factoring for all considerations, we believe that our going concern bid provides the best path forward for the company, the best option to save tens of thousands of jobs and is superior for all of Sears' stakeholders to the alternative of a complete liquidation,"" the ESL spokesman said. ""Much work remains and there is no assurance our proposal will be completed.""Sears will now evaluate the bid to determine whether it is viable, and there remains a possibility the company could reject it, some of the sources said.A Sears spokeswoman declined to comment. Bank representatives either had no immediate comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.A U.S. bankruptcy court judge must approve any sale of Sears. The judge will weigh the opinions of other stakeholders, including unsecured creditors who have argued they could recover more of their investment if the department store operator winds down.Without the financing or another buyer, Sears faces the prospect of closing its doors for good and putting roughly 68,000 people out of work.The 125-year-old retailer filed for bankruptcy on Oct. 15 and developed plans to restructure around the sale of 500 stores and businesses including Kenmore, DieHard and the company's home services division. Only Lampert's ESL offered to buy the entire company.The only other bids Sears has received are from suitors interested in pieces of the company and liquidators prepared to run going-out-of-business sales at stores and shut down the retailer.Sears dates back to the late 1880s.

Being big has its advantages, namely in helping the bank spread out its costs, but size has some disadvantages, too -- it's hard to grow a multitrillion-dollar asset base.This quarter, Bank of America surprised the market by delivering a 1.9% increase in net loans quarter over quarter, which annualizes out to about 7.8%. That's a marked reversal from the first nine months of 2018, over which net loans decreased by about 0.6%.Its global banking unit, which primarily lends to larger corporate customers, did much of the heavy lifting, as ending-period loans increased 3.8% quarter over quarter. Its consumer banking unit wasn't too far behind, as loans increased 2.5% quarter over quarter, resulting in a full year over which loans grew 4.9%, making it Bank of America's standout star.Image source: Bank of America.Bank stocks plunged in the latter part of 2018 as long-term interest rates fell and short-term interest rates increased. For most banks, that's a problem because it forces them to pay more for deposits even as what they earn on their loan portfolios decreases, cutting into their margins. But Bank of America customers aren't particularly rate sensitive; otherwise they would have moved their accounts years ago.That's helping Bank of America hold down its deposit costs even as rates on the short end of the yield curve are increasing. This quarter, Bank of America's interest-bearing deposits carried an average cost of 0.67% annually, up slightly from 0.55% in the third quarter and 0.32% a year ago. Approximately 31% of its deposits are non-interest bearing, meaning it doesn't pay so much as a dime in interest to those accounts.Yet even though Bank of America is keeping most of the benefit of rising rates for itself, customers are depositing more with the bank. In the fourth quarter, average deposits increased 4% year over year. The bank is winning larger commercial and corporate customers, as average global banking deposits increased 9.1% year over year.The big banks may get a lot of hate, but the reality is that they haul in an outsize share of new accounts. According to a Wall Street Journal story(subscription required), about 45% of new checking accounts opened in 2017 were opened at one of the biggest three U.S. national banks.Cynical investors are quick to point out that a bank's earnings are, in any given quarter, nothing more than an estimate. And it's true -- a bank's earnings can be impacted in a meaningful way by a bank's best guess of how much money it will lose to loan losses. Setting aside too little for bad loans will result in a bigger profit today at the cost of smaller profits, or even losses, in the future.Bank of America's fourth-quarter earnings beat wasn't accomplished with provision gamesmanship, though. The bank's allowance for loan and lease losses as a percentage of total loans decreased only slightly, falling to 1.02% of outstanding loans, down from 1.05% of outstanding loans last quarter.In other words, for every $100 of loans on its balance sheet, Bank of America has already ""earmarked"" $1.02 to cover bad loans, down just slightly from $1.05 last quarter. Loan losses remain low, as net charge-offs stood at 0.39% of loans on an annualized basis this quarter.Bank of America has spent the better part of the past decade making itself leaner and more efficient, shuttering unprofitable branches and investing in mobile banking features to service its customers less expensively. Finally, that work is starting to pay dividends.The efficiency ratio, which divides what a bank spends on noninterest expenses (branches, personnel, phone bills, you name it) by its net revenue, fell below 60% for the full year. Part of this was easy to accomplish -- rising rates increase revenue with few incremental costs -- but the simple fact of the matter is that a larger portion of net revenue is making its way to the pre-tax profit line.Data source: Bank of America presentation.With countless regulatory fines, branch bloat, and zero-interest-rate policy in the rearview mirror, Bank of America's earnings power is finally starting to show.The big banks are paying out nearly all, and sometimes more, of their net income to shareholders by paying dividends and buying back stock. Share repurchases are a big part of the earnings growth we've seen on a per-share basis.In the past year, for example, Bank of America's average diluted common shares outstanding (the denominator in its diluted EPS calculation for the full year) decreased by about 5%. Splitting the bank's earnings power across a smaller number of shares results in a larger amount o f earningson a per-share basis.Bank of America returned roughly $25.5 billion to shareholders by buying back stock ($20.1 billion) and by paying dividends ($5.4 billion) in 2018, equating to nearly more than 95% of its net income to common shareholders over the year.That may not be sustainable -- bank earnings are highly cyclical, and they must retain earnings to grow -- but for now, buybacks have provided an important lever in driving earnings, which will become more apparent next year, when year-over-year comparisons no longer include the free and easy benefit of a sharp drop in corporate tax rates.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

While Uber will not beat Lyft to an IPO, the preparations are aimed at giving it the flexibility to go public as early as the first half of 2019, the sources said.These banks will support Morgan Stanleyand Goldman Sachs Group Inc, which Uber hired late last year to lead its public offering, the sources added. Uber will make additional bank hires in the coming weeks to complete the IPO syndicate, the sources said.The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Representatives for Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup and JMP Securities declined to comment. Uber, Allen & Company and Deutsche Bank did not immediately return requests for comment.Several investment banks held off pitching Lyft for an IPO role in order to be hired by Uber, a more lucrative and high-profile assignment given its size and status. However, JMP Securities managed to get on both Uber and Lyft's IPO syndicates, showing that such overlap is possible, albeit mainly with more junior underwriting roles.Lending relationships between the companies and the banks have also proved important in winning IPO roles.Lyft's top-tier of seven underwriters was responsible for around a quarter of capital raised through last year, compared to more than 40 percent for the six top-tier banks that Uber has hired so far, according to Dealogic.Like Lyft, Uber filed confidentially for an IPO with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in December. Its bankers have indicated it could be valued at as much as $120 billion, though some analysts have pegged its value closer to $100 billion based on the earning figures it discloses.Lyft could be valued close to $25 billion in its IPO, according to the sources.Earlier on Tuesday, Uber agreed to pay $20 million to settle a lawsuit brought nearly six years ago by drivers who claimed they are employees, not independent contractors.

Fastly's plans are not final and could still change, the people cautioned.Fastly would be the latest technology company to gear up for a public markets debut in what is shaping up to be a record- breaking year for IPOs.

It also offers security, video and streaming services.Like many of its peers in web infrastructure, Fastly has benefited from a broad-based transition away from hosting enterprise software on internal servers and toward the so-called cloud, which provides software and other business tools over the Internet.Fastly, based in San Francisco, serves customers in industries ranging from e-commerce to travel, hospitality andfinancial services.Its competitors include Cloudflare, which recently raised $150 million in the private markets. Reuters has previously reported Cloudflare also hired banks for an IPO later this year.Fastly has raised a total of nearly $220 million, including a round of $40 million last year, which executives said could be its last private fundraising round ahead of an IPO.

A Tesla 2017 prospectus showed $624 million in loans to Musk.The filing on Thursday showed Musk owed money to three banks working on the capital increase.Goldman Sachs Group Inc has $213 million in loans outstanding to Musk, while he owes Morgan Stanley$209 million, and another $85 million to Bank of America Corp . Goldman was not mentioned as a personal lender to Musk in the 2017 filing.Those loans are backed by Musk's shares in Tesla, currently worth a total of around $8 billion. If Tesla's stock declines, then Musk could be forced to sell some of those shares under terms of the loan, according to the Tesla filing.Mark Williams, a professor of finance at Boston University, said that investment banks can run into conflicts of interest with their deals with companies, their founders and CEOs, testing their rules to keep different businesses separate.""This is particularly true in the case of Tesla where you have an aggressive and vocal CEO who is prone to pushing the legal limits and gain terms that might run counter to Goldman's conflict of interest policies,"" Williams said.Goldman and Citigroup Inc , the top-line book runners in Thursday's capital raise, both have ""sell"" ratings on Tesla's stock, which is unusual but not exceptional on Wall Street.At the end of 2018, Musk and his trust had 13.4 million Tesla shares pledged as collateral for personal debts, according to another filing. That is down from 13.8 million shares at the end of 2017.Tesla, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to talk about the loans. Tesla has a policy that caps executives' borrowings at a quarter of the value of the shares pledged as collateral.With Tesla repeatedly pushing back forecasts for turning a profit, its stock has dropped 27% year to date.Musk plans to buy another $10 million worth of shares as part of the sale announced on Thursday.","BankingandLoans,USMarkets,Stocks","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Joe Biden on Social Security: 6 Things You Should Know', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/joe-biden-on-social-security-6-things-you-should-know-cm1156990', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf0fef583ce45048fabf55e'}}, {'news_title': ""Here's How Green Thumb Industries Delivered Record-High Sales in Q1"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/heres-how-green-thumb-industries-delivered-record-high-sales-in-q1-cm1156991', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf0fef583ce45048fabf55f'}}, {'news_title': 'Novartis (NVS) Reports Positive Phase III Data on Asthma Drug', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/novartis-nvs-reports-positive-phase-iii-data-on-asthma-drug-cm1156987', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf0fef583ce45048fabf560'}}]","{'$date': '2019-05-02T20:20:00Z'}"

Investors attending the roadshow said Uber's IPO book was quickly oversubscribing, making a pop in the shares of the company on its first day of trading more likely. Uber declined to comment on how much demand there is for its IPO.Uber executives arrived in New York after their roadshow in London on Monday. In a ballroom at Claridge's, the five-star hotel in London's wealthy Mayfair district, over 100 investors listened to Khosrowshahi and Chief Financial Officer Nelson Chai talk about the company's plans to expand their food delivery business and venture into other new business areas like shopping.In New York, Uber executives fielded questions ranging from autonomous driving to plans to enter into the grocery business.Uber has cautioned in its IPO filing that it may never make a profit, and faces hurdles such as increased regulation and local minimum wages that could hamper profitability.Uber follows smaller rival Lyft Inc , which went public with a $24 billion valuation. Lyft's shares are down more than 17 percent since its IPO on March 28, amid investor skepticism over its path to profitability.Khosrowshahi is also tasked with convincing investors that he has successfully changed Uber's culture and business practices after a series of embarrassing scandals over the last two years.Those have included sexual harassment allegations, a massive data breach that was concealed from regulators, use of illicit software to evade authorities and allegations of bribery overseas. Khosrowshahi joined Uber in 2017 to replace company co-founder Travis Kalanick who was ousted as CEO.Uber's IPO is being led by Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs Group Incand Bank of America Corp .","Politics,USMarkets,Stocks,IPOs","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Validea Warren Buffett Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 6/1/2019', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-warren-buffett-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-612019-cm1157690', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf274f283ce450d4f65682a'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 6/1/2019', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-peter-lynch-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-612019-cm1157688', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf274f283ce450d4f65682b'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Motley Fool Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 6/1/2019', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-motley-fool-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-612019-cm1157686', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf274f283ce450d4f65682c'}}]","{'$date': '2019-04-30T16:17:00Z'}"

Yet while earnings per share of $0.70 handily beat consensus estimates of $0.66, the bank's stock was immediately down a few percentage points after the release (though it has rebounded as of this writing). In addition, some analysts actually downgraded the stock after the company's report and conference call.The culprit is the usual concern for the beaten-down banking sector -- investors continue to worry we're nearing the end of the current economic expansion, with a more challenging interest-rate environment due to a flat yield curve. Banks benefited toward the end of last year due to higher interest rates on loans, but with the Federal Reserve now on ""pause,"" investors think that bank margin expansion may be over ... and could potentially reverse. Bank of America did face some pressure on margins in the first quarter, along with a challenging capital markets and investment banking environment. In fact, the company's revenue was slightly downyear over year.And yet there's a lot more to Bank of America's story than the net interest margins it earns on loans. In fact, Bank of America management often highlights a different, non-standard metric in earnings presentations that is arguably much more important to investors.Image source: Bank of AmericaThough it's not a standard GAAPmetric, operating leverage takes center stage at Bank of America. Management defines operating leverage as net revenue growth minus non-interest expense growth.This is important because the highlight of CEO Brian Moynihan's strategy over the past few years has been one of strict cost cuts, combined with technology investments to increase efficiency. Though Moynihan's strategy also calls for revenue and loan growth, those targets are more modest, at GDP (Gross Domestic Product) plus 1 to 2 percentage points. Growing too fast can be dangerous for a bank, and as one of the largest banks in America, Moynihan is determined to grow responsibly.The good news for shareholders is that the company achieved its 17 thstraight quarter of positive operating leverage in the first quarter, clocking in at 4%. The first quarter's operating leverage came entirely on the expense side, with non-interest expense declining over 4%. But that's not abnormal: Due to the lumpiness of the bank's sales & trading and investment banking businesses, Bank of America has had six quarters in the past four years in which it's experienced revenue declines. Yet in all of those quarters, it's been able to cut expenses by an even greater amount, keeping the operating leverage streak alive.Impressively, the company's efficiency ratio, which tracks non-interest expenses as a percentage of revenue, fell from 60% to 57% year over year. Such a big decline is hugely impressive for such a large bank.While GDP-plus doesn't sound particularly enticing to many, the focus on cost cuts and safe loan growth can make for surprisingly exciting earnings-per-share growth. Even in a quarter when revenue was slightly down, the company's operating leverage, combined with ample stock repurchases over the past year, allowed Bank of America to grow its EPS by a whopping 13%.It's not often that you see a company grow EPS by 13% while its revenue is down, but that's what's happening with Bank of America, thanks to Moynihan's ruthless cost-cutting and huge stock buyback program.In light of the current flattish yield curve, Management did guide for the company's net interest income to slow to 3% in 2019 -- about half the 6% growth rate posted in a strong 2018. In addition, the company did predict some headwinds in the second quarter, with the potential for sequential declinesin net interest income, due to mortgage prepayments. However, management expects these second-quarter headwinds to be one-off declines, with a rebound in the second half.Meanwhile, management  guided to flat non-interest expense for the full year compared with 2018. So, while it's possible that the company's 17-quarter streak could come to an end next quarter, 3% growth on top of flat non-interest expense would still drive positive operating leverage for the full year.Bank of America's conservative strategy isn't garnering much love on Wall Street -- the company trades at just 11.5 times trailing earnings and 9.5 times forward earnings. However, showy and exciting growth numbers can potentially lead to danger in the banking industry. But if Bank of America can continue to grow EPS by double digits -- a rate higher than its current PE multiple -- patient investors could be in for exciting returns.Billy Dubersteinowns shares of Bank of America and has the following options: short April 2019 $26.5 puts on Bank of America.

She rejected requests by the banks to be reimbursed for their costs and for indemnity for claims that could result from compliance with the order.It was unclear whether the banks will appeal. Attorneys for the banks either declined to comment or could not immediately bereached.The quest for bondholder information is related to an attempt by the board and some creditor groups in the bankruptcy to have the federal court void more than $6 billion of defaulted general obligation (GO) bonds sold in 2012 and 2014, as well as debt issued by Puerto Rico'sPublic Buildings Authority and bonds sold for the island's Employees Retirement System.The board filed bankruptcy for the island in May 2017 to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations. But it did not seek to void the GO bonds on the basis they were issued in violation of debt limits in the Puerto Rico Constitution until January 2019, just months before the statute of limitations on bringing such actions runs out in early May.U.S. District Court Judge Laura Taylor Swain is scheduled to take up the board's motion to extend that deadline at an April 24 hearing.","Stocks,BankingandLoans,Politics","BAC","[{'news_title': 'This High-Yield Stock Is Making All the Right Moves', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/this-high-yield-stock-is-making-all-the-right-moves-cm1157823', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf2a36d83ce45105b8260fe'}}, {'news_title': 'Better Marijuana Stock: HEXO vs. Supreme Cannabis', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/better-marijuana-stock-hexo-vs-supreme-cannabis-cm1157824', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf2a36d83ce45105b8260ff'}}, {'news_title': 'Customers Still Love Alaska Airlines More Than Delta', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/customers-still-love-alaska-airlines-more-than-delta-cm1157825', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf2a36d83ce45105b826100'}}]","{'$date': '2019-04-18T16:28:00Z'}"

Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $23.34 billion, up 0.92% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $2.87 per share and revenue of $94.03 billion. These totals would mark changes of +9.96% and +3.05%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for BAC. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.24% higher. BAC is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Digging into valuation, BAC currently has a Forward P/E ratio of 9.96. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 10.67, which means BAC is trading at a discount to the group.Meanwhile, BAC's PEG ratio is currently 1.25. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. The Banks - Major Regional was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.24 at yesterday's closing price.The Banks - Major Regional industry is part of the Finance sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 170, putting it in the bottom 34% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.To follow BAC in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.","Investing,InvestingIdeas,Stocks","BAC","[{'news_title': ""What's Driving Our $34 Price Estimate For DowDuPont?"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/whats-driving-our-34-price-estimate-for-dowdupont-cm1157704', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf2a63783ce45105b8283a5'}}, {'news_title': 'Raytheon (RTN) Stock Moves -1.1%: What You Should Know', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/raytheon-rtn-stock-moves-11-what-you-should-know-cm1157626', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf2a63783ce45105b8283a6'}}, {'news_title': 'Cypress Semiconductor (CY) Stock Moves -0.39%: What You Should Know', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/cypress-semiconductor-cy-stock-moves-039-what-you-should-know-cm1157627', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf2a63783ce45105b8283a7'}}]","{'$date': '2019-04-02T17:45:22Z'}"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you'll have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Please note this call is being recorded.And it's now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.Lee McEntire-- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsGood morning. Thanks for joining this morning's call to review our 1Q '19 results. By now I trust that everyone's had a chance to review the earnings release documents, which are available on the Investor Relations section of bankofamerica.com's website.Before I turn the call over to the CEO, Brian Moynihan, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. After Brian's comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio will review the details of the 1Q results. After that, we'll open it up for all of your questions.For further information on forward-looking comments, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website or our SEC filings.With that, take it away, Brian.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThank you, Lee, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning to review our first quarter of 2019 results. In the first quarter, we reported $7.3 billion of net income after tax, the best quarter in the Company's history.So, let's begin on Slide 2. This slide shows the building blocks in achieving another record quarter. It also shows our commitment to responsible growth, and how it drives our shareholder model. We reported diluted EPS of $0.70, which grew 13% from the first quarter 2018. This reflects a nice mix of both operating improvements and capital returns.Pretax income of $8.8 billion, grew 4%, you can see that in the upper right, and we generated operating leverage of more than 400 basis points, which you can see in the lower right. Asset quality remains strong, as net charge-offs remained around $1 billion, the same level they have been for several quarters. Provision expense is up year-over-year to match those net charge-offs more closely and we had a small reserve build this quarter against the net reserve release last year.Through disciplined capital deployment, after meeting all the requirements to make loans to our customers and support their businesses, we continue to drive our share count lower. You can see that on the lower left. We are well under way with our goal to wring out the dilution in shares caused by the increased capital build after the crisis.Through share buybacks, our diluted shares are down 7% compared to the first quarter of 2018 and down 1.5 billion shares in the past four years.Turning to Slide 3. Part of responsive growth is to produce sustainable results, and part of that is to drive operational excellence, and we did it again this quarter. As you can see on Slide 3, we extended our positive operating leverage streak to 17 consecutive quarters. As you think across the last four years or so, we've had many different markets out there, many different interest rate environments, many different changes and perceptions in the U.S. economy and the global economy. All these things affect our business in a given quarter, but what has been constant behind that is our ability to drive operating leverage. We achieved it differently in different quarters, but as shown here, we achieved it consistently.When you think of our Company, there are three broad and diverse buckets of revenue, two of which have annuity-like characteristics and one is more susceptible to prevailing market conditions. The first bucket is spread revenue from loans and deposits, and the second bucket is recurring fees, like our cash management fees in our commercial businesses or our consumer account fees or interchange and things like that. The third bucket of revenue, which are more market related would be the sales and trading revenue, the investment banking fees and asset management brokerage revenue, which are both dependent on market levels at a given moment and market activity, giving rise to those levels.So, if you think about this quarter versus last year, our market related types of revenue was down 12%. The other two non-market related revenue sources were up 7%. That shows you the diversity in this Company. And all in, that ended up with flat revenue growth. However, our laser like focus on expense management came to the table again and resulted in year-over-year expense decline of 4%, which resulted in the 400 basis points of operating leverage. All you can see as you move to the right-hand slide -- right-hand side of Slide 3.When you think about how we are driving the Company, for managing expenses, we continue to invest in the future. Our expenses have come down from $57 billion to $53 billion and change over the last four years or so. And we've been driving the operating leverage in each quarter during that time, but we also continue to invest deeply in our franchise. And why do we do that? Because it is working. We're getting more business as we add relationship management capacity, increase our marketing and drive deeper penetration of U.S. markets through the full franchise entry and more and more markets across the United States.We also continue to invest in our people with industry leading benefit plans, both in health and retirement, with industry-leading capabilities and universities to train and reskill our teammates and plus the pay plan we announced recently, we are going to increase our minimum wage over the next 26 months from $15 an hour plus to $20 an hour. We need to do that because we need the best teammates to make this great client work -- Company work and work for our clients.Across the Company, we added 500 new sales professionals this quarter, more consumer relationship bankers, more wealth advisors, more commercial bankers and more business bankers, more small business bankers and more investment bankers. And as we have discussed many times, our initial spending for technology has been running around $3 billion for many years now, but is currently, the savings (ph) from tax reform expected to be 10% higher in 2019.We continue to enhance both our physical network for delivering products and services to clients, as well as the facilities we operate in communities and countries around the globe. All in, Bank of America invests around $2 billion a year in capital expenditures to build out, enhance our buildings, facilities and infrastructure.As it relates to our financial centers, our ATMs and other physical build-out, the point is we haven't just announced what we'll do, we're halfway through the broad-based build-out in our consumer business. We're executing the plan we laid out several years ago. But importantly for you, the cost to complete the work is already embedded in all our expense guidance. It's in fact embedded in our current run rate.So, we drive operating leverage and we invest and we see returns on that investment. One of the ways that we get a return on that investment is through our digital capabilities. Each quarter we show you the charts on Slide 5 of our digital customer statistics. Because as I discuss with many of you, we sometimes miss the obvious. What is driving this trend? It's a change in our customers' behavior. We are continuing to serve our customers in every manner possible.The customer can have their cake and eat it too; take it out digital, physical 24 hours a day cash and electronic payments, checks and wires and ACH, a loan officer, an online application, a fulfillment of their mortgage. It is their choice. 37 million digital users now, with 27 million of those mobile. And we now have 27% of our sales transacted digitally. 77% of our deposit transactions are now done through digital means. This means more of our financial centers and teammates and their time can be devoted to important events in the client's financial lives.We welcome 800,000 customers a day into our financial centers and they remain very important to our capabilities. And we continue to invest in those financial centers to upgrade them and make them more modern. And while consumer payments growth slowed, from the 8% to 9% pace of a year ago, to a 3% pace in the first quarter 2019, over the strong quarter in the first quarter of 2018, that still amounted to over $700 billion in payments in the quarter. An example is, part of those payments you can see in the Zelle users, have grown to more than 5 million active users and we processed $16 billion of payments for them this quarter.So, if you look at the drivers of our income, let's go to Slide 6. We'll spend a couple of minutes on client activity on these matters. Average total deposits grew $63 billion on a year-over-year basis. This is our 14th straight quarter of growth of $40 billion or more organic deposit growth versus the prior year. Global Banking grew deposits at an 8% pace as did Wealth Management. Consumer Banking deposits grew by 3%. Consumer core checking grew 7% from last year, showing more households are choosing us to be their core bank.Our pace of growth has consistently exceeded the industry's growth rates. Customers value the capabilities and rewards of their relationship and continue to see lower attrition and 90% plus primary bank status. In addition, Wealth Management also saw strong growth of deposits in their relationships. Our Global Banking team continues to benefit from strong customer demand as we continue to deploy bankers and treasury officers across our franchise.Within Global Banking, you will note that commercial customers move balances from non-interest bearing to interest bearing. As the treasury credit rate we give them for their balances to pay for their services rises, they play to need less non-interest-bearing balances. However, this change stabilizes when the rate curve stabilizes, as it has.As we go to Slide 7, let's talk about average loans. The good news is the average impact of late fourth quarter growth we spoke to you about last call was complemented by further good growth during the first quarter. Particularly promising was a strong rebound in our middle market customer base, where we saw growth and line usage increase. This means middle market companies are increasing their own activity, as they draw lines to finance raw material purchases, payrolls and other investments. Overall, from a corporate top of the house level, we grew loans 1%. However, looking across our business segments, core loans grew $33 billion, or 4% on a year-over-year basis. That's consistent with our responsible growth model.The lower left-hand chart shows the core business growth has been consistent across the last five years or more. Consistent growth consists of the responsive growth for several years and the growth rate improved this quarter. In fact, this quarter, our earning balance in Commercial Banking showed the highest linked quarter growth rate in the last six years.As we move to Slide 8, you can see the highlights for the quarter. I've covered a lot of the core points here, so I want to focus a little bit on returns. Despite a modest increase in the average balance sheet, our return on assets in the Company was 126 basis points and improved both on a year ago and a sequential quarter basis. Our return on tangible common equity was 16%. Our efficiency ratio continue to move down to 57% from 59.5% last year.With that, let me turn it over to Paul to walk you through more details of our first quarter results. Paul?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, everyone. I'm starting on Slide 10, since Brian already covered the P&L. Overall, compared to the end of Q4, the balance sheet grew $23 billion, driven by the equity financing business. Liquidity remained strong with average global liquidity sources of $546 billion and all liquidity metrics remained well above requirements. Long-term debt increased $4 billion, common shareholders' equity increased $1.7 billion from Q4, as the value of our AFS debt securities benefited from the decline in long-end interest rates, thereby increasing AOCI.Partially offsetting the increase was the return of more capital than we earned this quarter. We returned $7.7 billion, or 112% of the net income available to common, through a combination o f dividendsand share repurchases.Turning to regulatory metrics. Total loss-absorbing capacity rules became effective in January and at the end of March, our TLAC ratio comfortably exceeded our minimum requirements. Our CET1 standardized ratio was flat at 11.6% from Q4 and remained well above our 9.5% regulatory requirement. The ratio was flat, because the increase in AOCI, mentioned earlier, was offset by higher RWA, primarily in Global Markets.Turning to Slide 11, I want to spend a few moments on NII, given the changes in the rate environment. Net interest income on a GAAP non-FTE basis was $12.4 billion -- $12.5 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q1 '18, GAAP NII was up $606 million, or 5%. The improvement was driven by the value of our deposits, as interest rates rose, as well as loan and deposit growth, partially offset by lower loan spreads.On a linked quarter basis, GAAP NII was down $128 million. In Q1, we benefited from yields rising on our floating rate assets, as short-term rates rose. We were also disciplined with respect to deposit pricing and we benefited from loan and deposit growth, particularly commercial loan growth. However, higher short-term rates also increased the cost of our long-term debt and other global marketfunding costs.Additionally, lower mortgage rates muted the benefits from increased short-term rates. The net of all these things was still a benefit in the quarter. However, this net benefit only partially mitigated the seasonal impact in Q1 from two less days of interest, which cost us roughly $180 million. Net interest yield of 2.51% improved 9 basis points year-over-year, but was down 1 basis point linked quarter.Deposit rates in our Wealth Management and Global Banking businesses increased, however, we saw minimal movement in our consumer business. Overall, the average rate paid on interest-bearing deposits of 166 (ph) -- excuse me, of 76 basis points, rose 9 basis points from Q4 and is up 40 basis points versus Q1 '18. That compares to an average increase in fed funds of 97 basis points year-over-year.Turning to the asset sensitivity of our banking book, the drop in long-end rates increased our asset sensitivity compared to year-end. In addition, we are now modeling modestly lower deposit pass-through rates, given our experience in this rate cycle. Given the recent moves in rates, I thought I would provide some perspective on NII for the rest of the year.On a full year basis, NII grew 6% in 2018, in a rising rate environment and an economy that grew approximately 3%. The economy is expected to grow more moderately in 2019 and rate expectations have been lowered, plus we have some seasonal headwinds in Q2. But through loan and deposit growth and picking up two additional days of interest over the next couple of quarters, we would expect growth in NII to be consistent with or slightly better than growth of the general economy. More specifically, in Q2, typically sees higher funding of client activity in global markets, related to the European dividend season, which aids trading revenue, but reduces NII. We also typically see less benefit from loan growth, driven by paydowns on year-end credit card balances in Q2.Finally, long-end rates have fallen across Q1 and remain lower. This should drive higher prepayment of mortgage-backed securities, which will cause bond premium write-offs. These headwinds will be partially mitigated by one additional day of accrued -- of interest accrual. Across the second half of the year, we expect NII to benefit from growth in loan and deposits, as well as an additional day of interest in Q3. Ultimately, we expect NII for the year -- for the full year of 2019 to be up roughly half the pace of 2018. This perspective assumes today's forward curve and loan and deposit growth, consistent with the current economic environment.Turning to expenses on Slide 12. We continued to improve efficiency. At $13.2 billion, we were down $618 million, or 4% compared to Q1 '18. This reflected efficiencies from a full year of work across the enterprise to simplify and improve our processes, as well as lower FDI insurance costs. We also reduced managers and management layers over the last year, cutting bureaucracy and complexity. By the way, in terms of headcount, we are replacing many of these managers with sales professionals. We also saw and entered some intangible amortization in our Merrill business related to the merger 10 years ago. Compared to Q4 '18, expenses are up $149 million, due to seasonally elevated payroll tax expense, partially mitigated by timing of marketing and tech initiative plans.In addition, 4Q was elevated by the mismatch between accounting for certain deferred benefit programs and the accounting for related hedges, as the overall market declined in Q4. This went the other way in Q1 with the markets rebound.Our efficiency ratio improved to 57%. I would also note that we filed an 8-K earlier this year in which we reclassified some expense to revenue, resulting in an approximately $200 million reduction in full year 2018 expense. With the expected expense levels for full year 2019 and 2020, as you know, we increased for 2019 our planned level of initiative spending, supporting both physical and digital expansion and we've made announcements of further investments in our people, like our minimum wage increase. Despite these increases, we still believe we will meet our target o f reporting expense for the next two years that approximate our reclassified 2018 levels. However, please note that the quarterly progression of expenses in 2019 may look a little different than the past years, as it will be impacted by the timing of planned technology and marketing spend.Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Asset quality continued to perform well, driven by long-term adherence to responsible growth and a solid U.S. economy. Net charge-offs were $991 million, $80 million higher than Q1 '18 and $67 million higher than Q4. Comparing to Q4, we saw typical seasonality in our credit card portfolio. Compared to the prior year, we continued to see modest seasoning in our credit card portfolio. In Q1, there was also one charge-off related to a single utility client, which increased losses by $84 million, impacting comparisons against both periods.The net charge-off ratio was 43 basis points. The loss ratio has now been below 50 basis points in all, but three quarters of the past five years. Provision expense was a little more than $1 billion and closely matched losses this quarter. Provision included a modest $22 million net reserve build. Looking forward, we expect net charge-offs to approximate this quarter's $1 billion level for each of the remaining quarters in 2019, assuming current economic conditions continue.On Slide 14, we break out credit quality metrics for both our Consumer and Commercial portfolios. Here you can see both the seasonal increase in consumer losses, as well as the impact of the commercial charge-off, I mentioned. With respect to consumer metrics, both delinquencies and non-performing loans trended lower, which we believe is a good indicator of future asset quality. In commercial, we did have a modest increase in non-performing loans and reservable criticized exposure, but as a percent of loans, both metrics remain near historic lows.Turning to the business segments and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. Earnings grew 25% year-over-year to $3.2 billion. Q1 reflects continued strong momentum from 2018, as deposits grew $23 billion, or 3%, revenue grew 7% and expenses were down 4%, creating operating leverage of 11%. Despite the expanded physical footprint, the all-in cost of running the deposit franchise declined 6 basis points year-over-year to 1.64%, which includes both the cost of deposits, as well as rates paid. The efficiency ratio has now declined to 45%. Credit costs remain low. The net charge-off ratio was 128 basis points, increasing only 1 basis point year-over-year.With respect to client activity, we continued to increase the number of accounts, while maintaining primary account status above 90%. More customers enrolled in preferred rewards, more customers used our digital channels for service as well as sales, and more customers used our expanded and enhanced physical delivery network. While remaining healthy, growth in consumer spending has slowed to 3%. This seems quite natural following two years of spending growth above historical averages, especially given the backdrop of an economy, which has modestly slowed. And remember, growth in spending in Q1 '18 was fueled by confidence following tax reform in late 2017.Consumer lending was also solid, growing 5% year-over-year. The recent dip in mortgage rates has improved momentum in the mortgage market on both refinance and purchases. Originations were up 22% from Q4. With respect to small business owners, we've been investing in our capabilities. For example, we've streamlined underwriting, enhanced credit card features and added specialists.Loans to small businesses are quickly approaching the $20 billion level, up 6% year-over-year. Solid activity with consumers is also evident in the growth of our investment assets. Investment assets in the consumer segment ended the quarter up $29 billion from Q1 '18 on solid flows and a Q1 '19 market rebound. So, customer activity remained solid across all major product categories.Okay, turning to Slide 16. Note, the year-over-year improvement in Consumer Banking NII, which drove our 7% growth, as we realized the value of our deposits through our focus on relationship deepening. Card income was down 3% year-over-year, driven by higher rewards. Higher rewards were impacted by a number of factors. First, we saw more customers sign up for preferred rewards. Second, as some clients deepened their relationship with us, the amount of their rewards increased. Lastly, we added features that made it easier for customers to earn and view the rewards. While these types of improvements increase rewards, we believe they also deepen the relationships across multiple products, improving retention and profitability. Service charges were 2% lower year-over-year, as we continue to make policy changes to reduce certain overdraft fees for customers. Lower ATM volume also had an impact.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 17. GWIM's results were impressive, particularly given the revenue impact of the markets decline at the end of December. Relative to 2018, the business continued to gain momentum, growing net new households, which not only added to solid AUM flows, but also drove another strong quarter of brokerage flows.Net income of just over $1 billion grew 14% from Q1 '18. Pretax margins remain strong at 29%. The business created 360 basis points of year-over-year operating leverage, as expense declined 4%, while revenue was down only modestly. Within revenue, positive impacts from the banking activities and AUM flows were not enough to overcome lower market valuations, declines in transactional revenue and general pricing pressures. The expense decline of 4% was driven by lower FDIC insurance costs, lower revenue related to incentive costs and merger-related intangibles, which are now fully amortized.Moving to Slide 14. Q1 results reflect continued strong client engagement in both -- at both Merrill and the private bank. Strong household growth in both businesses and continued low attrition of experienced financial advisors contributed to the $17 billion in overall client flows.On the banking side, deposits were up $20 billion year-over-year, which included inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018. We also saw deposit outflows of about $8 billion, as the market recovered. Loans were higher by 3% year-over-year, reflecting strong mortgage growth, given the decline in rates. We also saw growth in custom lending.Okay, before discussing Global Banking and Global Markets separately, I know many of you look at these segments together. So, for comparison, note that on a combined basis these two segments generated revenue of $9.3 billion and earned $3.1 billion in Q1, which is a 16% return on their combined allocated capital.Looking at them separately and beginning with Global Banking on Slide 19, the business earned $2 billion and generated a 20% return on allocated capital. Earnings were up 2% from Q1 '18, driven by operating leverage. Revenue was up 3% year-over-year. We saw positive impacts from loan and deposit growth, as well as higher interest rates. We also saw higher leasing revenue. These increases more than compensated for a decline in investment banking and loan spread compression.The business created more than 400 basis points of operating leverage, as revenue growth was matched with a 1% decline in expenses. Lower deposit insurance costs more than offset continued investments in technology and bankers. Lastly, provision expense increased year-over-year, driven by the single-name charge-off mentioned earlier, as well as the absence of the prior year's energy reserve release.Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q1 last year, let's focus on IB fees. We and the industry felt the impact of the government shutdown, as the SEC was closed for some period of time in the quarter. IB fees of $1.3 billion for the overall firm decreased 7% year-over-year. This was relative to a global fee pool that is estimated to have declined 14%. Year-over-year, we saw good performance in advisory fees, up 16%. This was more than offset by declines in both debt and equity underwriting fees. Within debt underwriting, leverage finance rebounded from a tough -- from tough conditions in Q4. But primary issuance remained slow, and in investment grade, we saw lower than expected offerings to finance share repurchases. Fee pools in ECM were also down year-over-year.Switching to Global Markets on Slide 21. As I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. Global markets produced $1.1 billion o f earningsand generated a return on capital of 13%. While Q1 saw a seasonal rebound from Q4, we were down from the first quarter of last year. Q1 '18 was a record for the equities business, fueled by higher client activity and a spike in market volatility. And in Q1 '18, the equity business included a large client derivative -- client-driven derivative transaction.Overall, revenue declined 10%, while expenses declined 6%. Sales and trading declined 13% year-over-year to $3.6 billion. FICC declined 8%, while equities fell 22%. The decline in equities was more modest, adjusting for the one large client trade in the year ago period. Much lower market volatility this year resulted in less client activity and weaker performance in equity derivatives. FICC's lower revenue was due to lower client activity and less favorable markets across both macro and credit-related products. Investors remained cautious through the quarter, given geopolitical concerns and market volumes were light for both primary and secondary trading. We had no days with trading losses in the quarter. The year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue-related costs.On Slide 22 you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remained weighted to domestic activity, where fee pools are concentrated. Within FICCs, we remain more oriented toward credit products than macro.All right, finally on Slide 23, we show All Other, which reported a net loss of $48 million, which was relatively unchanged from the prior year period. Given the recent changes to our financial statements that enhanced certain allocation methodologies, we believe the ongoing profitability or loss in this unit should not be much different from Q1, absent unusual items. This quarter there was the normal seasonal tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation of about $200 million. This moved the tax rate in the quarter from our expected full year rate of 19% to the reported 17% rate in Q1.Okay, with that let's open it up to questions.Operator(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.John McDonald-- Autonomous Research -- AnalystHi, good morning. Paul, I was hoping to just clarify the outlook for the net interest income. It sounds like you expect NII to be down sequentially in the second quarter on a few of those pressure points that you mentioned, and then to grow some in the back half, as loan and deposit growth and day count get more favorable.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, that's right. I mean as we said in the prepared remarks, we've got some near-term headwinds, some of them are seasonal, some of them recurred long when rates were down. But as we move to the second half of the year, we expect to benefit from continued loan and deposit growth, plus another day of interest in Q3. So, ultimately, we think the full year 2019 NII is going to be up roughly 3% year-over-year. By the way, when I gave the -- in the prepared remarks when I gave the net charge-off for that single credit, I transposed the numbers, I said $84 million, it was really $48 million.John McDonald-- Autonomous Research -- AnalystOkay. Just -- and on that outlook for 3% NII in 2019, is that assuming no rate hikes and still a pretty flattish curve?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, that assumes the curve as it is here today, which is flat.John McDonald-- Autonomous Research -- AnalystOkay. No hikes?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerCorrect.John McDonald-- Autonomous Research -- AnalystAnd then in terms of your rate sensitivity, you mentioned that they had gone up. How do you think about managing rate sensitivity at this point in the cycle, and actions to potentially protect NII in a flattening curve environment from here, or rate cut scenario from here? How do you think about how sensitive you want to be?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, look, we -- we're not a hedge fund, we're a bank and so we are customer-driven, and our asset sensitivity is driven by our loans and our deposits and the activity that our customers do with us. Having said that, we have limits on how -- how much asset sensitivity we want on the upside and the downside, we're within those limits. There may come a point in the future where we would do something to modify the asset sensitivity of the Company. But remember, when you're doing that you're basically replacing the (inaudible) on the future -- future rate of -- future change in interest rates, what if you're wrong? So, again, we're a bank, we're serving our customers. That's what creates the asset sensitivity in the Company. There may come a time we'll adjust that, but right now we feel comfortable.John McDonald-- Autonomous Research -- AnalystGot it. Okay, thanks.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.Glenn Schorr-- Evercore ISI -- AnalystThanks. Appreciate it. I know it's within the NII construct that you just gave. But I'm curious, you made a comment on -- in the quarter, the non-interest bearing to interest bearing shift in deposits continued, but you thought it would stabilize as rates do. I'm just looking for some color on how real-time is that, in other words, if we get no hikes for this quarter, next quarter, do you think you see an almost immediate stop in that shift?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think -- Glenn, what I was saying was that the -- you got to look at what drives the value of the consumer deposit franchise in the Company and that's the consumer side. And what you're seeing is consumer deposits grew $26 billion and checking grew $24 billion, OK. And so, between non-interest and variable interest checking. So, that's what drives our account. We have 0.5 million more checking accounts than we did a year ago, to give you a sense, in a book of 34.5 million, went to 35 million.On the non-interest bearing side, the reference was in the commercial side, which, because the way cash management services are priced, when the rates rise, you people have to hold less balances to get the fees, hence (ph) credit rate goes up. When rates stop rising, which really has happened, that stabilizes and we have seen that and expected that to continue.Glenn Schorr-- Evercore ISI -- AnalystOkay. Maybe that ties into my follow-up on -- maybe small, but the service charges, especially the deposit-related fees are down 4%, or 5% year-on-year. It seems like a steady trend down. Is that a customer behavior thing, or has Bank of America changed anything on how it charges fees?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe continue to think about and continue to change our policies on overdrafts, which has a downward effect on it. But the real driver of that is the fact that we have primary households. So, the people are above the limits of free checking, for lack of a better term, in that, if you get $250 a month in direct deposit and then you can get a free -- the account is free. The fees are waived if you have $1,500 average balances, et-cetera, et cetera. And so, the profitability of consumer franchise is a combined profitability of the deposit value and the fee value. And together, you saw that revenue grow 7% year-over-year. So, it is not we price on a relationship basis. So, you have to be careful to look at this thing in parts.Glenn Schorr-- Evercore ISI -- AnalystUnderstood, thank you. Appreciate it.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Steven Chubak-- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHi, good morning. So, wanted to ask a question about some of the remarks in the context of an operating leverage line. So, a core tenet of the investment case has been your ability to deliver sustained positive operating leverage. I think Slide 3 actually showcases that quite well. Just given the current outlook for loan and deposit growth and expectations for expenses to increase year-on-year at least for the remainder of '19, are you still confident, given the NII guidance and your ability, to continue that momentum and deliver positive operating leverage even in the absence of higher rates?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I mean, look, the way I would think about it is, we've given you guidance on expenses, we've told you that in '19 and '20, we expect that our expenses will be approximately what they were for full year 2018 on an adjusted basis. And so, we're going to create operating leverage if we grow loans and grow deposits and grow revenue. I mean it's as simple as that, if we're holding expenses flat.Steven Chubak-- Wolfe Research -- AnalystOkay, fair enough. And just one follow-up for me on TLAC, Paul, since you gave some incremental color this quarter. I think I asked it on the last call, but I was wondering if you could provide some more detail, since you noted more explicitly that you're operating comfortably above the required levels. Given the much higher interest expense associated with long-term debt, I was hoping you could actually size that excess TLAC cushion, and whether there is any appetite to optimize your TLAC ratios to maybe help reduce that interest expense burden, especially given the tougher operating -- rate backdrop that we're currently operating in?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSure. There's obviously appetite and interest in optimizing. We'll be disclosing in the Q a lot of detail around the TLAC, the different TLAC ratios. I guess a couple of things, as you see those. Remember, we received approval of $2.5 billion of additional buybacks in February. We've also been setting up a new bank entity and a new broker dealer for Brexit, plus we're creating a new broker dealer as part of resolution planning. So, our funding needs are a little bit elevated right now. We need to optimize that over the long term. And we'll sort all that out.Steven Chubak-- Wolfe Research -- AnalystAll right. That's it for me. Thanks very much.OperatorAnd our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead.Gerard Cassidy-- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you. Good morning. Paul can you give us some more color? If I heard you correctly, you mentioned that the equity business included a very large derivative client-driven transaction, Can you give some more color on what that was?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI'm not sure I would give you more color on the specifics of the relationship or the client. We don't like to comment on individual clients. But, look, it impacted -- I think, if you backed it out, equities would have been down, how much? 13%? 12% instead of the 22%. So, it was a meaningful transaction last year.Gerard Cassidy-- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystOkay. And then second, you guys have done obviously a very good job in holding (ph) the line on expenses. Can you give us some color on where you think the efficiency ratio could eventually get to, and you can operate consistently at that level?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell Gerard, I think it's just -- as we said, it continues to drift down. Where stops we don't ever try to give people a number for free, it will stop there, and then not keep pushing. And so our job is to continue to drive it down. So, with flat expenses in a rising NII of -- like Paul described, you're going to see that all just obviously falls to the bottom line. But remember, the NII component is really very marginal from the standpoint, 0.5 million checking accounts on 35 million of consumer, $20 billion more investment assets in Merrill Edge, the wealth management business grows on a very leveraged platform.So, if you look across the efficiency ratio or the pre-tax margin, wealth manager, 29% efficiency ratios. You can -- they'll continue to get better. All in, that will help in a quarter where markets are up. You'll see that number drop down quickly in a quarter where markets -- market activity is less, which year-over-year that market activity was less than last year. So, we saw a little deterioration on that side, even though we made 250 basis points improvement overall. So, I don't -- if I say to you guys on this call, or my team will say, oh, we made a goal, so the goals to continue to drive it.Gerard Cassidy-- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystVery good, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.Betsy Graseck-- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystHi, good morning. Couple of questions. Just on the expense question, one more for 1Q. I mean you came in with an extremely low expense ratio this quarter. Do you see that more as a one-off due to the fact that the revenues were a little lighter in the capital markets for the reasons you mentioned earlier? Or, is this a good number that as we look forward year-on-year to 1Q '20, you could improve on?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, again, let me just take one step back. We've given our perspective on what we think 2019 and 2020 is going to be. We've said, with all the investments we're doing, the increase in technology, the merit, healthcare, everything we're doing, adding bankers, adding financial centers, we think because of digitization, because of all the efficiency, we think we can hold expenses at that 2018 level. So that's how I would think about it. If you just think about Q1 expenses, they were up approximately $150 million for Q4. Q1, obviously included the normal $400 million-ish of seasonality of elevated payroll expenses.This was sort of partially offset by the timing of some tech initiative spend and marketing costs, which combined were kind of down about $200 million quarter-over-quarter. But we expect both of those to be up for the full year of 2018, as we continue to invest. We mentioned in the prepared remarks the deferred comp issue, which had a quarter-over-quarter effect. We mentioned the Merrill Lynch intangibles, which was about $75 million. But having said all that, for the year is what I would focus on, we think we're going to be at $53 billion and change.Betsy Graseck-- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystYeah. Okay, that's helpful. And then can you speak a little bit to the loan growth side, because we got the NII overall and understand the NIM trajectory here, but can you just give us a sense as to what's in your outlook there for loan growth and if there's any variance between the different buckets that would be helpful to?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think, Betsy just to give you -- for our Company and for the U.S. economy, especially, where we saw some strong -- strong, relatively strong performance was in our middle market business this quarter, in our small business. And those -- that's good, because that means the core tens of thousands of customers in middle market and the millions of small businesses are using their lines and line usage went up by 1% in middle market, small business I think originations were up 7%, 8% year-over-year in the quarter.So, I think, if you think about the thing overall, that's good news. And so as we think about it long term, the run-off, if you go back to that page and look at the non-core portfolio, it's gotten to a point now where it's small enough, the impact is muted. So, the 1% overall growth and 5% core growth, we'd say the 5% core growth is in line with our expectations. The 1% overall ought to, frankly, start to mitigate, because that number of non-core loans is really just down to a much smaller number. And frankly, we sold -- this quarter we sold off some of the toughest loans, just to kind of get ourselves positioned in case, no matter what happens next. So, expect us to see the core loan growth in that mid-single digits and expect maybe a little bit more, but come through the bottom line as the non-core runs off.Betsy, just to follow up on your question to Paul on expenses. We are driving the Company hard to continue to reengineer it on a consistent basis. So, the digitization that you saw in the consumer business, which we talked about a swing through the commercial businesses fairly consistently. The cash per product, the cash per mobile product and things like that are growing. And so that was a very digitized business from sending cash, it is a little different to consumer. But the activity between us and the customer, the paper to electronic -- any -- one form of electronic to another form of electronic frankly saves us expenses, but also put some pressure on revenues, even though the treasury services revenue, as you can see, are up nicely.So, expect that -- we're going to do everything we can on expenses, we're going to make the investments of $3 billion in technology, we're going to continue to drive the physical plan, the rejuvenation and continue to add people, because it's working. But don't -- don't ever think that we're trying to -- we're not overspending here. We're going to spend what we need to do to drive this Company for you.Betsy Graseck-- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystGot it. Yeah, I mean -- and one point you mentioned something like $5 billion spent annually on storing and moving cash and check, is that still kind of the tag line for that?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWe're chipping away, it's still high. Even check deposits continue to go down in a franchise. Year-over-year in the first quarter they went from about a $140-odd -- $145 million (ph) in last year first quarter, $125 million to $127 million (ph) I think it was this quarter. But if you look at it, the -- and just that changed, the mobile deposits were up $15 million -- 15 million units in the same quarter, where the financial centers are down, excuse me -- the mobile were up a 1 million units in the same quarter, but the financial centers were down about 1.5 million units or 1.25 million units.So, each year, we are driving that incremental change. So, that's just checks deposit that's not even cash distributed and stuff. So, just that it is a big cost, a lot of it's on the commercial side too and when we continue to try to drive it down, collecting all that coin and currency to the small businesses and people and they collect cash as part of their operations. We continue to try to digitize that too.Betsy Graseck-- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOkay, that's great. And just one last question from me. I know you've been planning on increasing hiring in the investment bank, especially around the middle market. And I'm wondering do you feel that you are fully baked there with your headcount, or is there still some more room to ramp that, and thinking about what the impact is going to be on the loan growth, as you indicated earlier?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerSo, if you look at it, think about this time last year and into the summer, we continue to look at our position, we've been adding people. We still have room to go and add people. It's all in the numbers you see. So as expenses came down, we added more people in that area, in both middle market bankers filling out the franchise in various areas and investment bankers dedicated to that area, the team has been building up. And then frankly rounding out our general teams in investment banking.And so, Matthew Koder came in and picked it up. We're seeing market share sort of improvements in -- even in markets, which are not as robust as we'd like from our standpoint. But we expect that the middle market one has been growing very fast. It's a matter of just getting more capacity, it's sometimes, -- you look, some of those numbers were up 25% in fees over the last couple of years, we just got to keep driving.Betsy Graseck-- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOkay. Thanks Brian.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerJust to give you a sense on progress, if you look at hiring year-to-date versus last year in investment banking and capital markets, commercial bankers, it's at three-times the pace as it was last year. And attrition is down. So, we're definitely making progress.Betsy Graseck-- Morgan Stanley -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystHey, good morning guys. On the interest rate sensitivity, you gave the reasons for why the sensitivity moved up long-end rates and deposit assumptions. But at a point in time, what is the breakout of the $3.7 billion between short and long-end right now? Sorry, if I missed that, you broke it out.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, it's 75% on the short end, 25% on the long end.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- Analyst75%, 25% still, OK. Also you have been under -- you've had some pressure obviously with higher short-end rates on the sales and trading NII. I assume your 3% growth, does that assume some easing of pressure as rates stabilize here?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, as rates stabilize, we shouldn't see much change in NII in that business.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystOkay. So, it's assuming no rebound, because as assets reprice and funding cost remain stable?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat's right. That moves pretty quickly through the system, but it -- the 3% includes that as part of the balance.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThere just isn't a lot of asset sensitivity in Global Markets.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystOkay, fair enough. Just to change gears, on cards, income was down 2% year-on-year, volumes were up only 2% year-on-year. Can you just give a little bit of color what's going on there?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, sure. Look, the first thing I would say is, again, Brian said it, but remember we're focused not on products, but on increasing and deepening relationships. And remember, consumers revenue was up 7% year-over-year and profits were up 25%. To your question, purchase volume growth has slowed, but it was still up 3% year-over-year. We've got high rewards also pressuring revenue, but again, higher rewards are also driving higher deposit balances, which help NII, as well as client retention. We continue to add more than 1 million new cards each quarter, although this is down moderately, as we focus on profitability and reevaluate applications that are looking to play the rewards game.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystOkay, got it. Then just one final thing. So, you saw -- can you just give us an update where you are in the process and how you're thinking about, when you will give us a day one impact?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So, we've made a lot of progress and our efforts are continuing. We did a parallel run in Q1, which we're still analyzing. But based upon the earlier estimates from that parallel run, we do expect CECL reserves to increase. I think it's important to point out there is still a lot more work to do, but we would currently estimate the impact to be an increase in our reserves of up to 20%. I want to emphasize that sort of any adjustment to reserves will be based upon the composition of our portfolio and the forecast of economic conditions at that time, which is going to be year-end.In addition, we haven't finalized our methodologies. And, look, if you're thinking about drivers, it's obviously credit card is the primary driver. Relative to others, you got to look at commercial real estate. Those are the things that are affecting reserves.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystGot it. That's really helpful. Thank you.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerJust so you know, that equates to that 20% -- that up to 20% equates to a reserve increase of about $2 billion.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystGot it. It's not material for your capital. I get it. Okay.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, from a capital perspective, it's going to get phased in over three years.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystYeah, understood.OperatorAnd our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Matthew D. O'Connor-- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning. Any thoughts on the NIM percent going forward? Obviously, there could be some quarter-to-quarter volatility, but just as we think about the underlying direction on NIM, can you hold it stable, or might it bleed down a little bit?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerLook, longer term I think NIM is going to depend on the forward curve. I mean that's the best answer I can give you. In Q2, I guess, I would expect NIM to decline a little bit because of all the items I mentioned earlier in those prepared remarks. It's up year-over-year nicely. I think if you look at the banking book, you can really see the power. It's up to sort of 3.03%, which is up 10 basis points year-over-year.Matthew D. O'Connor-- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay. And if we just take the forward curve, which is what's in your net interest income dollar guidance, would that imply some underlying pressure beyond 2Q as well?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerNo. I think-- again, I think, it's going to be -- it would imply flat, I think, is what I would say.Matthew D. O'Connor-- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay. And then just --Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerOver the whole year.Matthew D. O'Connor-- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystSo, what do you mean by that? So down a little bit in 2Q and then up a little bit like last year (ph) to get back to 1Q? Got it.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThat's right. That's right.Matthew D. O'Connor-- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay. And then just bigger picture question. Obviously, not just a concern for Bank of America, but as we think about exiting this year and we just take everything at face value that rates stay here and all these other assumptions they will probably change. But let's just hold on that. It does seem like revenue growth is going to flatten out as we get into 2020.And I'm just wondering like what you're thinking in terms of levers that can be pulled? You had a lot of discussion around expenses. Are there kind of new products or customer segments that you can go after? Essentially, are there revenue opportunities that you can control, independent of the macro, if the expenses are kind of lined up and flat and there is not too much more to do there?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerI think if you think about a growth rate and economy of 2 percentage points or so and you think back about the last decade, we've been at that level more than we've been at any other level. And what did we do? We grew loans mid-single-digit, we grew deposits 3%, 4%, 5% faster. It's now kind of growing at that rate. That adds basically a very advantaged cost of funds and loans that are well priced to our core clients in both the consumer and commercial side and that then grows the net interest margin.A lot of talk about, over the last few years about what was the contribution rates, half of it came more less from rates and half of it came from hard work and we expect the half that came from hard work to keep coming. And that's -- that leverage in a platform with expenses being flat is pretty good leverage. And then the markets will be what they are. But as I said earlier, remember that the revenue from those two activities year-over-year is up 7%.Paul gave you the -- an eye view of that. The fees side of that revenue was down deeply. But even with what's happened during the quarter, to think about the wealth management business from the way they're pulling prices off of December into January and things like that, think about the recovery, the fee income, even if it stays flat from here, it will be substantial in wealth management business. So, we feel good just grinding out more customer relationships and more loans and deposits and more wealth management business from them and that will give us a pre-tax -- ability to grow pre-tax in the mid- to upper single digits and then the share count through the capital management.So, that's the model of the 2% growth economy. If you tell me you are predicting a recession, we'd handle the Company differently as what everybody else, but that's not what we think. And then, as I think about it overall, we just -- this is a great franchise and we're just grinding out the growth that's embedded in it and that will produce, as we've said, mid single-digit, mid upper single-digit operating earnings increase, combined with share count will get you in double digits and that's pretty good.Matthew D. O'Connor-- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay. All right that was clear. Thank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Nancy Bush with NAB Research. Please go ahead.Nancy Bush-- NAB Research -- AnalystGood morning. Brian, this is a question about your program to lift the minimum wage from $15 to $20 over the next 20 months. And I can see how this is necessary, as you said ""to get the best people in an economy that has the unemployment rates that we do right now"". But can you just kind of generally flesh out what kind of productivity improvements you're seeing in the workforce, and whether this $5 raise will be paid for by productivity?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYes, it's going to be -- well, it has been, I think, in the last several years, we've gone from probably sub $10 and now to over $15 and it's been paid for every year. So, I think our ability to continue to drive productivity is really driven by the change in customer behavior and the digital capabilities we have. So, more of the activity that would have been done a decade ago or two decades ago, a person handing a check for deposit at the branches would have gone through a person's hands and now goes through a mobile bank deposit -- mobile check deposit and the cost of that is tenfold (ph) different. And yeah, we still have in this quarter alone, $50 million-odd deposits at the financial centers to work on.So, yeah, the productivity will increase. We've been able to pay for those kinds of increases. We've been able to keep the healthcare costs for the lower compensated teammates flat since 2011, after we cut it in half. And this is all to really have great teammates working with our core customer base and that's where we are focused on. And our average compensation of our Company is 90-odd (ph) -- $120,000 or something like that. So, this is not -- this is to really help drive in the branch and the call centers and the operations groups to continue the efficiency, but overall we continue to manage headcount down to make it happen.Nancy Bush-- NAB Research -- AnalystOkay. Also have a quick question about the credit cycle. Marianne Lake said on Friday that I think there were sort of five loans that came on non-accrual -- five material loans that came on non-accrual at JPMorgan Chase and that was the second quarter that it happened. And she characterized these credits as quote idiosyncratic, not belonging to any particular industry, et cetera. I guess my question is this, has the nature of credit cycles really changed due to the low rate environment? And how will you know if we are entering a ""new credit cycle""?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerWell, we continue to -- those are great questions, Nancy, when you think about it in a broader context. But I think the major differences with our Company is that the geographic distribution in the United States, means that we're not susceptible to any regional issues dominating our discussion, as it would have been 20, 30 years ago, even a decade plus ago. I think that the balance in the Company from consumer and commercial has come down has changed substantially. So, we're 50%-50%, I think the secured portion of consumers, the dominant part as opposed to going in the last crisis, so all that sort of gives us a different feel for what we think the credit cycle will be like.When you go to the commercial side, the underwriting capabilities, the team has then proven through cycles as being very strong, the ratings integrity is strong, when we go through with all the reviews, whether it's SNC or whether it's internal reviews. And so, yes, a Company, like the charge-off, we had in the fourth quarter, can have an idiosyncratic event that causes some damage. But will it be wholly different, it will really depend. If the economy stays bumping along that goes into slight degradation, you're going to see some across the board distress.But I think so far, as we've seen pieces pop up, oil and gas a few years ago, we put up reserves, and we took most of them back in. The retailing business, we were a major lender in it. We've been able to work through the credits there, because of the nature of the collateral and stuff like that. The consumer side, the charge-off rate stays low. We've worked through, as you know, a lot of mortgage credit that was just -- is still with us and we have been getting that down and that's brought our charge-offs or mortgage back to where we thought they'd be.So, I'm not sure I would ever say you have to take any credits that happen and say, there's no -- to say it's completely isolated one-off events, because you got to be careful not to fool yourself, but on the other hand, what we see is right now, the fundamentals of the economy in the U.S., on a global basis and the fundamentals of consumers and unemployment being low, as you mentioned, means that credits in good shape and we just don't see that changing a lot.Nancy Bush-- NAB Research -- AnalystAll right.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI'll just point out, I know, you're asking how will we know, but the one thing I do want to stress is, how much we've transformed the Company over the last 10 years by sticking to responsible growth, by changing the mix between consumer and commercial, by focusing on prime and super-prime. And again, the best place to see that is in the fed stress test results, where you can see that our loss rate over multiple years and we'll see what it is year, has been lower than all peers. And almost 50% lower than the worst nine quarters we experienced during the financial crisis. So, the Company is just fundamentally different.Nancy Bush-- NAB Research -- AnalystOkay, all right. Thank you.OperatorYour next question comes from Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Please go ahead.Al Alevizakos-- HSBC -- AnalystHi. Thank you for taking my question. You already mentioned about GWIM that it was a really impressive performance. When I'm looking at the numbers, clearly the outperformance, except for the solid revenues just coming from the expense line. And you mentioned a couple of factors during your prepared remarks, including the FDIC and the lower intangible amortization cost.I was wondering as a first question, whether you would be able to quantify like, what was the lower expense coming from the intangible amortization costs, and then from FDIC, especially in that division? Thank you.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSo, there was (ph) lower intangibles about $75 million per quarter. And FDIC, I think is a little over $100 millioin (ph) per quarter -- for the whole Company, yeah.Al Alevizakos-- HSBC -- AnalystSo, not only for the wealth management, just it's for generally all the Company?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, that's -- Merrill's intangibles is $75 million. FDIC for the whole Company is sort of like $150-ish million (ph) . So, Merrill (inaudible) they obviously don't get the whole thing.Al Alevizakos-- HSBC -- AnalystYeah. And as a second question, I think, I missed you at the end, when you were talking about the All Other segment. You guided basically that the Q1 is actually a good indicator for the future, but you also mentioned that there was this tax benefit of $200 million. So, what is actually the run rate? Is it the $50 million loss or the $250 million?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. Yeah, there was a sort of normal seasonal kind of tax favorability that I expect most people had in their models.Al Alevizakos-- HSBC -- AnalystYeah.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSo, if you adjust for that, you know, a good -- for modeling purposes, I would suggest you use around a loss of around $200 million per quarter. That's a good base.Al Alevizakos-- HSBC -- AnalystOkay. Thank you very much.OperatorOur next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Vivek Juneja-- JPMorgan -- AnalystHi, thanks for taking my questions. Couple of questions. I hear you on the card purchase volumes and the rewards expense, your card outstanding growth has also slowed substantially. It's gone from up 5% year-on-year last year in the first quarter, then it was in the 4-ish-percent over the course of the year, and it was flat year-on-year in this quarter. Can you talk about -- I heard you say that you are trying to avoid customers giving the rewards side. What about the card outstanding growth? Why has that slowed so much?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYou're talking about card balances?Vivek Juneja-- JPMorgan -- AnalystYes, card balances Paul, that slowed to flat year-on-year. And if you look over the course of the last five quarters, that's a slowdown from where you have been coming over the last year?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, look, we're -- look I would expect low single-digit year-over-year growth to sort of continue. Right now we are experiencing a little bit of an uptick in the portfolio payment rate that's affecting growth.Vivek Juneja-- JPMorgan -- AnalystOkay. And that's just -- you think just temporary that -- what's driving that, that it would only be temporary?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerLook, I just think it's good economy and we have high-quality customers in our card portfolio and they're taking some of their excess deposits and paying off their balances.Vivek Juneja-- JPMorgan -- AnalystOkay. Shifting gears, Brian, a question for you, investment banking. If I look at your -- I hear you on the fact that you've been hiring more bankers, Paul mentioned that too. When I look at your IB fees this quarter, at least based on the results, you have better come out thus far. It seems like you have slipped now to number 5. Any color on why? You used to number 2 a few years ago and it's gone. It's slipped further and further. Is it a risk issue? Is it an expense issue? What is the issue? And what should we expect as we look out, Brian?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerMy guess is, we'll end up 4 -- 4, 5 on fees paid, depending on what is going on at the time, It will ebb or flow. If it's more debt capital markets driven, typically we do better. If it's more equity capital markets, we do a little bit differently and if it's advisory we sort of -- depends on sort of what the deals are.At the end of the day, the team is continuing to work on driving it. We feel good at the progress is being made, and we'll continue to make that progress in the future. But I always tell people to keep in mind, in the Global Banking segment, our Company earned $2 billion, $700 million of which was investment banking fees. So, the key for serving corporate clients is to have a full robust broad relationship and drive the cash management and drive the lending and the investment banking, and not get overly focused on to get 2% of our revenues.Vivek Juneja-- JPMorgan -- AnalystOkay, thanks.OperatorWe will take today's last question from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead.Brian Kleinhanzl-- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. -- AnalystYeah, thanks. So, one quick question on the commercial. I guess, you're still kind of constructive on commercial growth. But can you point anything specifically, I think (ph) you're actually seeing an improvement on the commercial side, like line utilization up year-on-year, are you seeing more CapEx spending?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerYeah, there has been a lot of talk, if you think about the last couple of years, of the economy -- the last year and a half on economy, and commercial loan growth. And I don't get the fantods all over that. In a sense it's a -- things ebb and flow by what's going on. So, I think what you saw this quarter, really a combination of probably three things for us in the core commercial business -- yeah, commercial loans across the board.One is in terms of the business banking segment, which is a smaller and we've hit sort of an inflection point. We were managing some of the credit risk in that portfolio, that's kind of hit the base and that's a smaller book, but it does impact year-over-year. That was down like over $1 billion and that's now flattened out in terms of core linked quarter impact.Second thing is as the small business continues to grow, it does a good job in that and you can see that separately. The third most important thing is, we deployed more middle market bankers, they continue to deepen relationships and as we did it, we basically not only did we -- we took down the number of accounts per person, so that they could deepen the relationship to spend the time, that's why you're seeing the treasury service and other revenue grow. But importantly also, even pushing harder on the loan growth side and that's benefited us.And then, frankly, for years we were kind of running down a little bit of our commercial real estate. On a relative basis, you would have seen other people grow faster. As the market settled in and we liked the credit risk better, we've actually seen a little better growth in the commercial real estate segment, very high and very capable, very strong quality, that's helped us a little bit too.And then the last thing, which I think is good news, the economy overall, is the line usage went up about a point in middle market, which is -- which means that -- that's across a lot of lines, obviously. But what that really means is that people are using the credits, is the right word. So, the arduous task of doing -- driving commercial loan growth is really down to literally thousands of people out there every day doing the job that Matthew and Alastair and Acer (ph) and Sharon Miller and the team push them to do and we're seeing the benefits of that and that ought to be compounding in the future.Brian Kleinhanzl-- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. -- AnalystAnd then just a separate question on the card income. I know it has been asked a couple of different ways. But typically, there is some seasonality in the first quarter. Was the seasonality impacts greater than the rewards impact in that linked quarter decline in card income and consumer banking?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerThe impact of -- if charges were up and fees were down, obviously, the impact of the rewards, credits and other credits, both to the merchant and everything else exceeded the growth in the revenue. And so, I think that's a given. So, we are up 3% in charged volume, something like that. And then it overall declined slightly.You remember that we are running our credit card relationship management business different than a lot of people. We run it as an integrated business. And so when you see that $26 billion in deposits growth in consumer, remember a lot of it's coming in large deposit relationships in the context of general consumers and not wealth -- affluent wealth management people customers, is coming because they're bringing to us $10,000 or $20,000 in balances too, that is helping drive our deposit balances and the relationship size, in order to get the reward system.And so when you look at that, you got to be careful about looking any one line item that we have and look at it in total growth and that's a 7% consumer overall, and the risk-adjusted margin on the card product, I think we show is over 8%. So, it's very high credit quality and the fee is included in that. So, I think it's one of the differences. We're going to look a little different and so, yes, the amount we rewarded our customers to do business with us exceeded the rate of growth and they are charged a little bit. But combined with their deposit balances and how they get the rewards, you saw a consumer deposit level growth of mid-single digits, you saw $26 billion, which is the size of a good bank right there, just in consumer and it was all in checking.The total other growth, other than checking was like a couple of billion dollars. So, it's all checking growth and all really what we do for people in the card is part of that payments, debit card, credit card and checking are really linked accounts now.Brian Kleinhanzl-- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. -- AnalystOkay, thanks.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman and Chief Executive OfficerAll right. Well, thank you everyone for joining us again. We appreciate your interest. Another quarter, record earnings, strong client activity. We continue to see a good strong solid U.S. economy. We deepened those relationships. We had strong asset quality, and again, at the end of the day, we delivered a 16% return on tangible common equity, 126 basis points return on assets and we did that by driving operating leverage of 400 basis points. So, thank you. Look forward to talking to you in next quarter.OperatorAnd this will conclude today's program. Thanks for your participation. You may now disconnect.

That second test is more rigorous, assessing whether it is safe for banks to implement their capital plans. It also reviews operational controls and risk management.All eyes are on Deutsche Bank , which is bracing for potentially its fourth flunking in five years amid ongoing turmoil in its U.S. operations, Reuters reported on Thursday.Last year, the Fed failed the bank, citing ""material weaknesses"" in its data capabilities and capital planning.The Fed created the stress tests during the 2007-2009 financial crisis to ensure banks are strong enough to continue lending through a severe economic downturn.This year's tests are more streamlined following a Fed review of the process, which has long been hated by the industry. Roughly half as many banks were tested this year compared to 2018 after the Fed earlier this year moved several smaller firms onto a two-year testing cycle.The 18 banks tested this year hold roughly 70 percent of all U.S. bank assets, according to the Fed.In addition, most banks can no longer fail on ""qualitative"" grounds. Previously, banks that had sufficient capital could still be flunked if the Fed identified risk management and operational problems.In March, the Fed said it was dropping this qualitative objection for domestic U.S. banks. Only the U.S. subsidiaries of five foreign lenders -- Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse Group AG , UBS Group AG , Barclays Plcand TD Bank-- must clear that hurdle this year.Since the first test in 2009, banks have seen losses shrink, loan portfolios improve and profits grow. The largest banks have also strengthened their balance sheets by adding more than $680 billion in top-tier capital, the Fed said.This year's recession scenario included a jump to 10 percent unemployment, as well as elevated stress in corporate loan markets and falling real estate prices. However, the Fed also this year gave banks more information about the testing models, after years of industry gripes that the process is too opaque.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,Economy,401k,BankingandLoans,Retirement","BAC","[]","{'$date': '2019-06-21T16:41:00Z'}"

They are designed to avoid the taxpayer bailouts the government resorted to in the 2007-2009 financial crisis.Deutsche Bank's U.S. shares were up as much as 6 percent in after-the-bell trading following the announcement. Credit Suisse's U.S. shares fell as much as 3 percent.The Fed approved the capital plans of the 16 other banks that underwent this year's test, which includes the nation's largest lenders like JPMorgan Chase , Bank of Americaand Citigroup .JPMorgan, following the test results, announced plans to increase its quarterly dividend to 90 cents per share from 80 cents, starting in the third quarter, and buy back up to $29.4 billion of shares over the next year.JPMorgan shares rose as much as 1.9 percent while Bank of America shares were up 1.8 percent and Citigroup advanced 1.5 percent after-the-bell.JPMorgan was asked to resubmit its proposal after the Fed assessed its initial plan would result in the bank's falling below the minimum capital it is required to hold to cope with a downturn.Banks normally resubmit when they are pushing to return the maximum amount of capital possible to shareholders and overestimate what the Fed will allow them to do in their initial proposal, banking and regulatory sources say.FED CITES STRONG CAPITAL LEVELSThe Fed's stamp of approval gives Deutsche a major boost as it works on a restructuring plan. The bank flunked the test in 2015, 2016 and 2018. Another failure would have further damaged confidence among clients and investors at a time when Chief Executive Christian Sewing is battling to turn around the bank.In a memo to staff published on the bank's website, Sewing said the Fed's decision was ""excellent news"".""Achieving success here was one of the key goals we set a year ago. It is a huge step forward for our business in the U.S. and globally. A strong operating platform in the Americas is essential to our clients,"" he said.The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, ordered Credit Suisse to address weaknesses in its capital adequacy process by October, and restricted its capital distributions to last year's levels until the weaknesses are addressed. The Fed said it had identified ""weaknesses in the assumptions used by the firm to project stressed trading losses that raise concerns about the firm's capital adequacy and capital planning process."" It gave no further detail.Credit Suisse, in an emailed statement, acknowledged the concerns relayed by the Fed and said it expected to remediate the issues by the October deadline.The Fed said in a statement that the nation's largest banks all have strong capital levels and ""virtually all"" are meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.Deutsche's passing grade reflected the significant progress the bank had made in addressing its weaknesses around capital planning, although some issues remain, according to a senior Fed official.Deutsche's Sewing told investors at the annual shareholders' meeting last month that the bank planned to make ""tough cutbacks"" at its investment bank to appease investors unhappy with its underperformance. Those plans are likely to see the bank's U.S. equities business shrunk to a skeleton operation, Reuters reported this month.The stress test outcome means that Deutsche is now free to make payments to its German parent without approval from the Fed, a restriction which was imposed following the stress test failure last year.Deutsche maintained a large presence on Wall Street after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, while Credit Suisse made big cuts. However, Deutsche's efforts to compete with U.S. rivals have been hampered by litigation and regulatory investigations.All the 18 banks easily cleared the first portion of the Fed's annual stress test last week, showing they would easily have enough capital to keep lending during a severe economic downturn.The second test was more rigorous, assessing whether it is safe for banks to implement their capital plans.This year's tests are more streamlined following a Fed review of the process. Roughly half as many banks were tested in 2019 compared with 2018, as the Fed moved to a two-year testing cycle for smaller firms.($1 = 0.8801 euros)","WorldMarkets,Economy,401k,BankingandLoans,Technology,Retirement","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Nike Forges Ahead, Reiterates Full-Year Guidance', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/nike-forges-ahead-reiterates-full-year-guidance-cm1170362', '_id': {'$oid': '5d16642783ce4561bff9c6ab'}}, {'news_title': 'Why Shares of Progress Software Popped Today', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-shares-of-progress-software-popped-today-cm1170363', '_id': {'$oid': '5d16642783ce4561bff9c6ac'}}, {'news_title': ""Constellation Brands' Sales Jump Amid Restructuring"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/constellation-brands-sales-jump-amid-restructuring-cm1170364', '_id': {'$oid': '5d16642783ce4561bff9c6ad'}}]","{'$date': '2019-06-27T16:30:00Z'}"

Hector Vaca, one of the activists at the April annual meeting, declared victory.In the past, companies usually waited for controversies to lose steam and avoided taking a stance by declining to provide public comments, making changes slowly or not at all. Crisis communications experts say that companies are forced to act more quickly in today's fast-paced news and social media environment.""It's important to understand that companies in these situations have only bad options,"" U.S.-based crisis management consultant Eric Dezenhall said, adding that ""there is no playbook or everyone would use it.""Also this week, several hundred people, including employees of Wayfair Inc , rallied in Boston to protest the online retailer's alleged sale of furniture to a Texas detention facility housing migrant children. The spat was fueled when a letter to Wayfair leaders from employees about the sale spread on Twitter.Wayfair declined to comment on the alleged sale. But it promptly made a $100,000 donation to the American Red Cross to aid humanitarian relief at the border.The rise in activism accompanies a surge in ESG investing, or investing based on environmental, social and governance factors. Morningstar estimates funds that invest according to non-economic guidelines managed $1.2 trillion at the end of last year.It has prompted companies to disclose more about how, and with whom, they do business and tackle issues they might have tried to evade in the past.Last year, a deadly shooting spree at a Parkland, Florida, high school brought long-running arguments about gun control in the United States to the fore once again. This time, some companies that had sold guns for years changed tack.Dick's Sporting Goods Incstopped selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines, opting to make it a fully transparent move. The retailer's chief executive, Edward Stack, spoke about the decision on ABC's ""Good Morning America.""Many praised the company, but not everyone agreed it was the right thing to do. Same-store sales at Dick's declined nearly 2% in the quarter after the decision, as customers citing a violation of their Second Amendment rights to bear arms called for a boycott online.Walmart Incand Kroger'sFred Meyerwere among other retailers who also announced they would limit the sales of firearms and ammunition, in their cases only selling to buyers over the age of 21.Others change course more quietly.

The company defused employee uproar over the deal by not renewing the contract.""Historically, we've relied on companies to tell us about their ESG performance, but that doesn't work anymore,"" said Witold Henisz, a professor of management at the University of Pennsylvania'sWharton School.Younger generations, investors themselves and equipped with more access than ever to information about companies, are at the forefront of a more transparent, activism-fueled corporate universe, he said, stressing the importance of data when it comes to ESG investing.Millennials are ""even willing to take lower wages if they feel like a company has a strong social purpose,"" Henisz said.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,Politics","BAC","[]","{'$date': '2019-06-28T16:39:00Z'}"

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. Please note, this call may be recorded. I will be standing by should you need any assistance.It is now my pleasure to turn today's conference over to Lee McEntire. Please go ahead.Lee McEntire-- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsGood morning. Thanks for joining this morning's call for a discussion of our 2Q 2019 results. I trust everybody has had a chance to review the earnings release documents, which are available on the Investor Relations section of the bankofamerica.com website.Before I turn the call over to our CEO, Brian Moynihan, let me remind you that we may make forward-looking statements during this call. After Brian's comments, our CFO, Paul Donofrio will review the details of our second quarter results. We'll then open up for questions. For further information on any forward-looking statements, please refer to either our earnings release documents, our website, or our SEC filings.With that, I'll turn it over to you, Brian.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThanks, Lee, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us to review our second quarter results. Many of you discussed, written about and engaged in debate about the perceived change in the forward environment that we all saw this quarter. However, what we saw on our client base during the second quarter 2019 was solid consumer activity, pointing to a continued growing economy in the United States this year, albeit at a slower pace. In that environment, our company reported the bes t earningsquarter in the company's history, that is made possible through the hard work of my 209,000 teammates who are driving responsible growth.We reported $7.3 billion in after-tax net income and $0.74 per share. Both these items increased on a linked quarter and a year-over-year basis. Revenue on an FTE basis was $23.2 billion and grew 2%. We increased our return on assets to 123 basis points. Our return on tangible common equity was 16.2%. And in the end, responsive growth continued to prove strong earnings, returns and shareholder value.As we look at Slide 3, we start to highlight how we achieved these results. Revenue grew 2% and expenses were basically flat year-over-year. We generated operating leverage of more than 200 basis points. Our credit costs remain low and stable, so that resulted in year-over-year net income growing 8%. And during the past year, we bought back 7% of our shares. This reflects the model of combining solid operations with strong capital returns and then, thereby, driving strong core EPS growth. This quarter, diluted EPS grew 17% from the second quarter of 2018. All the way along, our capital and liquidity positions are very strong and continue to strengthen. Book value per share grew 10%. We also had important client growth and market share gains in our businesses. Client activity showed $75 billion of deposit growth, a growth rate of 6% year-over-year. We also had $37 billion of that deposit growth came from people, consumers. At the same time, we saw strong investment flows from those customers.Loans in our businesses grew $34 billion or 4%. Importantly, we saw progress in other focus areas as well. A year ago, I told you we'll continue to drive to regain our position in Investment Banking. As a nice start, we saw market shares across many of the products in investment banking in the first half of this year. One example is IPOs. We're number one in volume for US. IPOs in the first half. Matthew Koder and the team have done a good job and off to a good start driving this business. All-in, we're pleased with the results this quarter. We grew. We did it the right way. We stayed with our risk parameters, and we continue to invest heavily on our franchise, adding salespeople, more technology, increasing our marketing spend and improving and expanding our physical plant in all dimensions. These results also led to the highest first hal f earningsin the company's history.So as we look at Slide 4, we show you the last five years' results for the first half. For the first half of '19, we generated nearly $15 billion in after-tax earnings. Compared to the first half of '18, EPS was up 16%. And you can see that growth has continued for the last five years. In those years, we have driven operating leverage. You can see that in the lower right. This year, we saw that operating leverage continue in the first half. This led to a 57% efficiency ratio. We used the excess capital beyond the need for growth and investments in our company to buy back shares, a trend which has accelerated, and you can see on the lower left here. Now our primary goal of driving responsible growth has been to produce sustainable results even if the environment changes. This requires us to drive operational excellence in all we do, so that we can drive operating leverage, and we did it again this quarter.As you move to Slide 5, you can see our -- we have extended our positive operating leverage streak to 18 consecutive quarters. In those 18 quarters, you've seen many different market environments, changes in interest rates, economic growth that's sped up or slowed down, but we still managed to drive operating leverage for 4.5 years and successively. Generating operating leverage doesn't get any easier after four plus years. However, with that strong expense discipline, we remain focused upon it. Now one of the things that you don't see here and you see in our results is the improvement we're starting to see in some of the categories, especially consumer fees as you go through the quarters, the last four quarters. Over the last decade, we faced service charge headwinds in consumer from reductions in accounts and other fees related to accounts for many years. This was based off our consumer strategies, to strive to have the best-in-class franchise. We have lower fees because of the changes in overdraft policies. But also, most importantly, the drive we've had toward being the core relationship bank from an American consumer.Now in the recent past, from offsetting those rate of fee reduction by increasing the growth in the actual counts, the number of accounts we have that our primary household relationships in the past last few years. We have much higher retention than we've ever had, and we're improving client satisfaction to levels that hasn't been seen before. But most importantly, that focus on relationship depth has resulted in 92% of our households with primary and with an average balance of $7,000 plus. In card income, we're seeing the consumer debit and credit card spending at a 5% plus level year-over-year. This seems consistent with us to a 2% plus growth US GDP environment. We still are fighting the headwinds of the reward impacts that go on in that business and you see that in us and our competitors. But at the end of day, we're providing great value to consumers. And at the end of the day, when you look at the total relationships in those consumers, it's great economics for our shareholders.Now next couple of slides, we're going to do something we've done in each of the earnings reports for some time, but we're going to add a piece to it. We always have talked to you about our Consumer and Business Banking digital usage, which you can see on Slide 6. But importantly, on Slide 7, we'll talk about how that impact is now being driven across our corporate and global transaction services business. So first, let's start on Slide 6 with our consumers. Each quarter, we've shown you these charts. In the second quarter, we -- in the broadest context, we had 2.4 billion interactions in the second quarter alone with our consumers across all our channels. To show you how dominant it is by digital, 2.3 billion of those interactions were digitally or automated base. This explains why we have to be and are excellent both high touch and high-tech. If you look at our digital-only clients, meaning customers have not used a financial center in the past year, we have 30 million consumer customers across our platform who have -- are primary digital who have more than $400 billion in balances with us today. Their entire relationship is managed digitally, and the balance in activity continue to grow strongly. But that's not our business. Our customers want both physical and digital access. This is why we continue to invest heavily in enhancing our number one ranked digital platform while, at the same time, enhancing our best-in-class financial centers.And again, this quarter, you see the interaction of those two in the lower left-hand side of this slide where the record number of appointments that were set up. 580,000 times a person took to their mobile digital device set up an appointment to come into a branch in the quarter, and you can see that on the lower left. To better serve the 0.75 million customers that come into our centers every day, this quarter, we added another 17 financial centers to help drive the growth in our consumer business. We then renovated 45 more, bringing over 1,200 that we've renovated in the last few years. And we remain on track to not only hit the three-year targets we established 18 months ago of adding 500 new financial centers and the targets we established to renovate over 3,000. We also are adding many more relationship managers in these new centers and refresh a lot of centers to bring them up to our modern high-touch environment.Now one of the things that we hear a lot about is the millennial customer and the Gen Z customer. Our digital capabilities are one of the things that attracts millennials to our platform. Today, in our customer base, we estimate that we have 16 million millennial customer. Those are customers between the ages of 25 and 41. These millennials are very important for our growth, and they hold nearly $200 billion in deposits and investments with us. It's a powerful platform to all segments of the US consumer population.Now turning to Slide 7. While many of us focus on the consumer digital trends, I think it's also important to recognize the significant activity of the digital transformation in our commercial space. Over the past decade, we've been investing continuously in our global transaction services platform. And on Slide 7, we start to show the digital capabilities as part of that investment. We focus on making the business easier, faster, cheaper and more secure for clients and make it more convenient to access and be in business 24/7. We now have nearly 500,000 CashPro Online users with double-digit growth in mobile usage attached to that. Mobile payment approvals by these users were $123 billion in the past year, doubling year-over-year and growing very fast obviously. One of the latest enhancements, the type of thing that shows the innovation we have, is to have mobile tokens delivered through an Apple Watch to help corporate treasurers process payments. At the end of the day, the people who work with our companies -- in our companies want the same convenience that our consumers want, to be able to deliver the services.So let me end up here by addressing a few questions which are on your mind. Number one, many of you asked what we see if the expected forward yield curve comes true, i.e., the reduction in interest rates is in the curve. I asked Paul to lay out our thoughts on that and he'll do that shortly. The second question is, can your strong asset quality continue to last? Assuming the economic conditions continue to move along, we think that net charge-offs should remain low for some time and we've told you that for many quarters in a row. This is not because something we're doing in the second quarter of 2019. It's because of the work we've done over the last decade, to continue to maintain our risk profile on a consistent basis and drive toward that. We see no immediate credit concerns as evidenced by the volume or additions in non-performing loans or delinquencies or any statistics around credit that you can see in the documents. The third question is, OK, given an environment where you may see a slowdown in the economy, do you have further expense levers to pull? Well, one of the questions we get is because we manage expenses so well, is there more things you can do? We believe that it's important to continue to invest in the future of our franchise. Paul is going to talk to you about near-term expense guidance a little later. But importantly, the reason why we're investing is to produce -- these investments to produce a meaningful result. But our 2019 expenses are projected to be lower than 2018, and that brings us to every year in the last decade, we've had declining expenses except for one. But we as the managers you want us to be agree with you, that if there are severe economic issues ahead, we have the flexibility to continue to reshape this expense base. Obviously, starting with revenue-related cost, which would adjust quickly and automatically and then changing our investment strategies. I can assure that these areas we focus on and are on our mind just as on your mind.So with that, let me turn it over to Paul for a few more details on the quarter. Paul?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerGood morning, everyone. I'm going to start on Slide 8, since Brian already covered the P&L. Overall, compared to the end of Q1, the balance sheet grew $19 billion driven by loan growth, which ended the quarter more than $20 billion higher in our business segments. Liquidity strengthened in the quarter. Global -- average global liquidity sources of $552 billion, remained well above requirements, shareholders equity increased $4.4 billion, as we issued $2.4 billion in preferred stock ahead of plan call announced in July, and common equity increased $2 billion.Versus Q1, the $2 billion increase in common equity reflects an increase in AOCI as the value of our AFS debt securities rose, given the decline in long and interest rates. In total, we returned $7.9 billion in Q2, through common dividends and share repurchases, a 112% of net income available to common. As a reminder, we recently announced plans for a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend, as well as the increase in our share repurchases to more than $30 billion over the next four quarters. With respect to regulatory metrics are TLAC ratios remain comfortably above our minimum requirements, our CET1 standardized ratio increased to 11.7% remaining well above our minimum requirement of 9.5%, higher capital levels drove the increased AOCI, excuse me, higher capital levels were driven by the increased AOCI. Improved the CET1 ratio, while higher loan balances and commitments mitigated some of that improvement.Moving to client activity and starting with average deposits on Slide 9, average deposits grew nearly $75 billion or 6% year-over-year. This was the 15th consecutive quarter in which we grew deposits more than $40 billion. Global Banking alone brought in more than $39 billion. Global Banking continued to benefit from strong customer demand reflecting the additional bankers we have deployed over the last few years and the middle market franchise.We also continue to see a shift from non-interest bearing to interest-bearing deposits in global banking. Deposits with consumers grew $37 billion or 4% within that global wealth management was up $18 billion year-over-year, reflecting client growth with a preference to hold cash of mid-market uncertainty as well as inflows of about $8 billion from the conversion of some money market funds to deposits near the end of 2018. Consumer Banking deposits grew by $19 billion or 3% year-over-year. More importantly checking balances grew, while more expensive balances declined modestly. In fact, checking balances grew $22 billion or 6% year-over-year to $374 billion, while rate paid remained low at 9 basis points, up only 5 basis points year-over-year.Turning to average loans on Slide 10. Overall, our loans grew a little less than 2% year-over-year. Our all other portfolio is down to $45 billion and has been running off at a pace of approximately $2 billion per quarter, excluding loan sales, looking at loans across our business segments, core loans grew $34 billion or 4% year-over-year. Consumer, Wealth Management and Global Banking segments each grew at a healthy year-over-year pace. As you can see in the bottom right chart, we continue to demonstrate a fairly consistent pattern of responsible loan growth. Growth of loans to consumers was led by an increase in mortgages as lower interest rates stimulated more originations and allow many of our customers to lower the cost of owning their existing home or buying a new one. Within Global Banking, we saw increased activity for middle-market clients, complementing the continued activity from large global corporate borrowers.Turning to Slide 11. I'll not only review the drivers of our net interest income this quarter, but also provide a few perspectives on the future given the expectation of lower rates embedded in the forward interest rate curves. Net interest income on a GAAP basis -- on a GAAP, non-FTE basis was $12.2 billion, $12.3 billion on an FTE basis. Compared to Q2 '18, GAAP NII was up $361 million or 3%. The improvement was driven by the value of our deposits, as interest rates rose in 2018, as well as loan and deposit growth. On a linked quarter basis, GAAP NII was down $186 million. In Q2, we benefited from additional day of interest as well as loan and deposit growth, which was more than offset by three factors.First, lower long term rates resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-backed securities, which caused higher write-offs of bond premiums. Second, Q2 included higher funding costs from growth in non-earning trading assets and other global markets assets. And then lastly, lower short-term rates reduce yields on floating rate assets such as commercial loans. As a result of these impacts, net interest yield of 2.44%, declined 7 basis points linked quarter, but was up 3 basis points year-over-year.With respect to deposit rates. We remain disciplined and saw minimal movement in total deposit repaid at 57 basis point it increased just 3 basis points from Q1. With LIBOR rates lower than Q1 and the forward curve predicting further declines, we would expect client deposit rates to begin to move lower over the third quarter.Turning to asset sensitivity of our banking book. We remain asset sensitive, given the nature and size of our deposit base and the type of loans, our customers have sought from us. Our asset sensitivity in a rising rates scenario increased compared to Q2. This was driven by the decline in mortgage rates, which increases the likelihood of mortgages, a mortgage prepayments in the baseline. The lower current forward curve also caused increased asset sensitivity in the falling rate scenario.In the second half of the year, we expect NII to benefit from growth in loans and deposits, as well as an additional day of interest in Q3. However, lower rates are expected to have three primary negative effects; first, yields on floating-rate assets should continue to decline from short-term rate reductions; second, lower long-term rates may continue to stimulate mortgage refinancings causing increased write-off of bond premiums; and third, reinvestment rates on securities and mortgages will dilute the current portfolio yields.However, lower LIBOR rates should reduce the cost of our long-term debt and other funding partially offsetting these headwinds. Last quarter on our earnings call, we reviewed our expectations that net interest income could go roughly 3% for the full year of 2019 over 2018. That was based on a relatively flat forward curve at the time of our earnings call. Since tha t earnings callon a spot basis, the 10-year rate has fallen more than 40 basis points and short-term LIBOR rates are lower by 10 basis points or so. From here if we were to assume stable rates, we think our NII for 2019 would now be up approximately 2% compared to 2018. Additionally, the forward curve anticipates two fed fund rate cuts in 2019 and another in 2020. If rates follow the forward curve and the fed funds rate were indeed to be cut twice this year starting this month, we think it would likely shave another 1% of NII growth for 2019.Turning to expenses on Slide 12. We have now been pacing at our targeted level of non-interest expense for several quarters and our efficiency ratio has improved 100 basis points year-over-year to 57%. At $13.3 billion, we were basically flat compared to Q2 '18 with expenses up less than $50 million, while holding expenses roughly flat, we increased investment in our people, our brand, in technology and in office space. And as you know, we are adding and renovating financial centers, which serve, not only consumer clients, but also commercial and wealth management clients. Investment in people included adding more sales professionals, increased merit and benefit, as well as the shared success bonuses, which we have awarded for two consecutive years now. Since the portion of share success bonuses best over time, we are now covering those programs in our ongoing expense base. Also in the expense base is the increase in early Q2 of our minimum wage to $17 an hour.And as you know, we announced our intention to continue to raise our ROE minimum wage until it reaches $20 in 2021. Compared to Q1 expenses are also up modestly as Q2's decline from the seasonally elevated Q1 payroll tax expense was more than offset by the increase in investment, in initiatives, and marketing in Q2. In the second half of 2019, we expect our expenses to roughly equal our first half expense of $26.5 billion. We expect increased technology investment in the second half, plus the cost of adding new client-facing professionals to be roughly offset by the seasonally lower incentive costs. We previously projected that we could hold 2019 flat with our 2018 expense of $53.2 billion inclusive of these planned investments. However, as you heard Brian say, we now estimate expense in 2019 will be modestly lower than that.Turning to asset quality on Slide 13. Asset quality continued to perform well driven by our disciplined approach to underwriting in a solid US economy. As you know, the industry received annual stress test results this quarter, and once again, our loss rates in stress scenarios were lower than our major peers. Total net charge-offs in Q2 were $887 million, a little more than $100 million lower than Q1 and the year ago quarter. The decline was driven by the sale of $700 million of home equity loans, which resulted in a $118 million of recoveries from previously charged-off loans. Absent this recovery net charge-offs were just over $1 billion or 43 basis points of average loans and consistent with the net loss of rate ratio in Q1 and the prior year quarter.Outside of the normal expected Q2 seasonality in our credit card portfolio, we had a modest increase in commercial driven by a couple of single name losses. Provision expense of $857 million, excuse me, provision expense was $857 million and included a modest $30 million net reserve release. Our guidance on net charge-offs for many quarters now has been roughly $1 billion per quarter and that remains unchanged. This guidance assumes current economic conditions continue.Okay. On Slide 14, we breakout credit quality metrics for both the consumer and commercial portfolios with respect to consumer metrics delinquencies trended lower, which we believe is a good indicator of future losses. Additionally, non-performing loans continue to improve, even after taking into consideration the loan sales this quarter. And in commercial, we also saw a modest decline in non-performing loans, while reservable criticized ratios remained near historic lows.Turning to the business segments, and starting with Consumer Banking on Slide 15. Consumer Banking produced another strong quarter, earnings grew 13% year-over-year to $3.3 billion. Revenue grew 5% and we've created operating leverage of more than 400 basis points. The efficiency ratio also improved year-over-year to 45%. Even as we invest in new markets and renovate financial centers, the all-in 162 basis point cost of running the deposit franchise was relatively flat compared to Q2 '18, as the decline in the cost of deposits component offset the increase in rates paid. Client activity remained strong with loans and deposits showing solid growth. Mortgage originations clearly benefited from lower rates. Customer satisfaction improved, asset quality remained strong as a net charge-off ratio was 124 basis points decreasing 4 basis points year-over-year.And I would note that much of the loan growth that we have added to our balance sheet is high quality consumer real estate loans. We continue to add salespeople for consumer lending, investment adviceand small business lending. And we also increased our spend in marketing via campaign, where our 91 local market teams around the country ask their customers, what they would like the power to do.Turning to Slide 16. Note that the 5% year-over-year improvement in revenue was driven by NII, while card income was down modestly year-over-year, card spending grew 5% more than the prior year, which on its own was a strong quarter given elevated spending driven by tax reform last year. Versus Q1, we saw an improvement in card income driven by solid purchase volume. We continue to expect higher rewards to dampen card income, but would also remind you that we use awards to deepen relationships with a focus on total customer revenue not just fees. Enrollment and Preferred Rewards increased to $5.7 million and now represents 65% of the eligible opportunity and our retention rate of these customers is now 99%.Balances with these customers grew 11% versus Q2 '18. With respect to service charges, they were also down modestly year-over-year, again this quarter, we faced the headwinds from actions we took in previous quarters that reduced customer penalty fees. However, as with card versus Q1, we saw a modest improvement in service charges.Turning to Global Wealth and Investment Management on Slide 17, strong results were driven by new investment accounts and more traditional banking products as well as the markets rebound in the quarter. Referrals from across the company also gained momentum. Net income which approached a record level was just over $1 billion and grew 11% from Q2 '18. Pretax margin was a record 29%. The business created 240 basis points of operating leverage year-over-year, as revenue increased more than 3% and expenses grew 1%. Within revenue, positive impacts from banking activities and higher rates, growth NII higher, while fee improvements from AUM flows and market valuations more than offset general pricing pressures, with respect to expenses higher revenue related incentives as well as continued investment in new advisors, technology and brand were modestly offset by lower intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs. Digital used by affluent clients continues to gain momentum as mobile usage once again grew double digits year-over-year. For example, GWIM clients used e-signature twice as much as they did only a year ago.Moving to Slide 18, GWIM results reflect continued solid client engagement in both Merrill and the private bank, strong household growth in both businesses, contributed to the $2.9 trillion in client balances. AUM flows were $5 billion in Q2 or $24 billion over the past four quarters, contributing to record AUM balances, which rose 6% year-over-year to $1.2 trillion. On the banking side, deposits of $254 billion were up $18 billion or 7% year-over-year driven by client growth and the desire by some clients to hold more cash amid the market uncertainty.Linked quarter deposit outflows reflected seasonal tax payments by our customers. Loans were 3% higher year-over-year, reflecting strong mortgage growth given the decline in rates. We also saw good growth in custom lending. With respect to client activity, one thing worth noting is the increase in client referrals both to and from mail in the private bank advisors. This quarter we had nearly 15,000 referrals, two advisors from other parts of the company, and advisors made more than 58,000 referrals back to our other LOB's. In Q2, these introductions added $7 billion to client balances in GUM and help us grow households.As you turn to Slide 19. I know many of you look at Global Banking and Global Markets on a combined basis. So to help you with your comparisons, I note as I did last quarter that on a combined basis, these two segments generated revenue of $9.1 billion, $103 billion in Q2, which is nearly a 16% return on their combined allocated capital. Looking at them on a separate basis and beginning with Global Banking on Slide 19, the business earned $1.9 billion and generated a 19% return on allocated capital in the quarter. Earnings were strong, but down 9% from Q2 '18, driven by the absence of reserve releases for energy exposure in the prior year. Revenue was down modestly year-over-year as loan spread compression and ALM activities offset the benefit of loan and deposit growth.Strong deposit and loan growth reflects the hundreds of bankers we have added as well as continued investment in how we deliver our loan product and treasury service. With respect to expenses, lower deposit insurance costs, mostly offset continued investment in technology and bankers.Looking at trends on Slide 20 and comparing to Q2 last year. As you heard Brian mentioned earlier, we have made steady progress in investment banking over the last few quarters. We saw a nice finish this quarter with IB fees of $1.4 billion for the overall firm, down 4% year-over-year, but up 9% from Q1. This performance has to be put in the context of overall industry fees which according to Dealogic were down roughly 20% year-over-year. In fact, using Dealogic data, our market share has improved across most major products comparing the first half of '19 to the first half of 2018.Switching to Global Markets on Slide 21, as I usually do, I will talk about results excluding DVA. Global Markets produced $1.1 billion of earnings and generate a return on capital of 12%. Overall, revenue declined 6%, while expenses declined 2% year-over-year. Within revenue euro decline in sales and trading was partially offset by a gain on the sale of an equity investment. Sales and trading declined 10% year-over-year, FICC was down 8%, while equity fell 3%. The decline in equities to $1.1 billion reflects weaker performance in EMEA derivatives compared to a stronger year ago period.Fixed lower revenue was due to a weaker trading environment with lower overall client activity across most products. The 2% year-over-year expense decline was a reflection of lower revenue related compensation.On Slide 22, you can see that our mix of sales and trading revenue remains heavily weighted to domestic activity, where a global fee pools are centered. Within FICC, revenue mix remained weighted toward credit products and we had no days or trading losses in the quarter .Finally on Slide 23, we show all other, which reported a small net profit $358 million better than Q2 '18. There are two primary reasons for the improvement, first, provision benefit increased $136 million from Q2 '18, driven by the non-core loan sale, which as previously noted, resulted in a recovery of $118 million. Second, we had an improvement in our tax rate compared to Q2 '18. The tax rate for the company was 18% in the quarter, a little lower than our expectations. We expect the tax rate in the back half of the year to be approximately 19%, absent any unusual items.Okay. I think with that, we're ready for some Q&A.Operator[Operator Instruction] And we'll take our first question from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.James Mitchell-- The Buckingham Research Group -- AnalystHey, good morning, guys.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerMorning,James Mitchell-- The Buckingham Research Group -- AnalystHey, just might as well ask the question on NII. Appreciate the guidance for this year. How do we think about, I guess, number one, the impact of just one rate cut? Is it sort of half? Is it linear? And I guess, number two, as we think about next year, the forward curve is realized over the course of the next 12 months, how do you think about that impact into next year? And given the strong loan growth you guys have seen kind of accelerated in 2Q, is there enough asset growth that you can still grow NII in this environment next year? Thanks.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerOkay. So in terms of just isolating in on a 24 basis point cut on the short end, I guess a crude approximation is the $3 billion impact over the 12 months of 100 basis point down rate shock on the short end. The quarterly impact of that is a little more than $175 million, but it'll be even less than that because that $3 billion is measured relative to the forward curve, which already includes rate cuts. Plus that analysis is just on our banking book. If you include our markets book, which is modestly liability sensitive, you get to the approximately $100 million levels that I discussed in the prepared remarks. In terms of 2020, look, I would say, it's a little early to be talking about 2020. We don't know what rate cuts we're going to get. We don't know why we're going to get them, which is important. So I think as we get a little closer, we will be more likely to be to talk about that.James Mitchell-- The Buckingham Research Group -- AnalystOkay. Thanks.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerJim, I'd add one thing. Remember that if you think about the industry's thought process over the last three years basically as rates rose, that was one thought process in how people price deposits and other things. And as that changes, you'll see a different thought process take hold, at least in our company. And I think if you look at some of the statistics and materials on the -- especially on the corporate GTS type business that the necessary increase for the highest balance customers and et cetera, that's occurred, will slow down and come back the other way. And that, frankly, is just the nature of a change in the rate environment, which the pricing is still catching up to. And so I think -- so as you think about it, as you get out the longer term and '20, you have to think about that situation sort of reversing back to a different framework than the framework we have literally 200 plus basis points of short-term rate increases.James Mitchell-- The Buckingham Research Group -- AnalystOkay. Thanks.OperatorWe'll take our next question from Glenn Schorr with Evercore . Please go ahead.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Glenn.Glenn Paul Schorr-- Evercore ISI -- AnalystHi. Good morning. One quick one on follow-up on cards. You mentioned spending up, margin compressed and the reward costs continuing to be there but obviously producing some growth. Can you talk a little bit more about the reward dynamic? How long the current environment you think lasts? And how you know that it's going to continue to fuel that growth, maybe something a little bit more of growth coming from current customer base versus new ones, things like that? Thanks.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo just starting at end of your question and working backwards, we generated another 1 million plus cards this quarter. We've been fairly consistent doing that. What has really happened in our card business over the last few years has been the continued repositioning. It's really over now. And now you're starting to see it's starting to work its way up and grow just in terms of balances and numbers of cards and things like that. If you think about on the reward question generally, remember that, and you mentioned it, Glenn, it's a relationship pricing piece. So our cards come with a relationship pricing across the whole relationship, including deposits. So you can have $20,000 of deposits from these customers, and so you reward them with a card because that's the way that you can do it. But you're actually getting the deposit. So we'll keep working that. But if you look at the more recent quarterly trend, you're going to see that you've seen the impact decline, although it's still going to hit, but you're seeing that help fuel our deposit growth in checking deposits, especially at 6% year-over-year in consumer. And that is a huge payback for the rewards price. So you'll see that dynamic continue. We haven't seen big breakage fees, and that's not so volatile. It's kind of steady, but the industry dynamics and how people are using rewards not only for the card activity, but also more broadly is I don't expect to change. But in the Bank of America context, we've been using it for the broadest part of the franchise. And that's why you see the good growth in the other parts of the business.Glenn Paul Schorr-- Evercore ISI -- AnalystAppreciate that. One another one, a follow-up on wealth management. You mentioned new household growth up 45% year-to-date. Are you doing anything specific on incentives to spur that growth? That seems like a big number for such an already big business and the related question is, do you think of there being a ceiling to margins because they're already huge at 29%?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerA couple things. One, on -- just on the way the incentive system works. Andy and the team, going back two years ago now, basically added to a modifier, for lack of a better term, in the incentive compensation construct for a requirement bonus. If you grew your households on the numbers and obviously inverse that if you did not, and that's just led to the activity that you've seen in the pickup. And Andy and team have been done a good job. On the private banking side, we've been adding sales teammates, and Katy and the team have been driving that. It's been -- it's up dramatically year-over-year, and that's critically important because that business profitability dynamics have a much -- are even higher. And so it does come from modifying the system. And it also comes from the way we operate in the markets on a referral business that is in Paul's comments, you heard that. There's a huge flow between the FSAs that operate the Merrill Edge platform at the branch to the financial advisors. So if somebody comes in as -- and has the amount of assets and desires financial advisor, we move them to the platform. That happens a lot. And then off the Business Banking, the small Business Banking, commercial franchise, the entrepreneurs behind those businesses referred over and you saw, I think, 15,000, I think, was Paul's number toward Merrill. And we track that in every market. We make sure they get executed on the capital success rate, and that energy creates its goal in every market every year. And this year, we'll do 7 million referrals across all the businesses in the markets that we're doing.And so -- and then on the margin, if we move to 29%, as you see that NII type activity as loans and deposits continue to grow, that margin will continue to grow. We're fighting the fee compression on the pure asset management business that you've seen going on for years in this industry. But we have lots of advantage, scale and capabilities on the digitization of the operational side of that business and platforms and statements and things like that. We're getting to 50%, 60% digital statements in consumer. We're not anywhere near that in wealth management. And all that is not some snap your fingers and overnight it happens, but all of it, the grind to make the business more efficient. So our industry-leading margin, we think we can keep pushing it up.Glenn Paul Schorr-- Evercore ISI -- AnalystThanks. I appreciate it, Brian.OperatorWe'll now go to Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.Mike Mayo-- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystHi. I was intrigued by your comments about 16 million millennial customers, $200 billion of deposits. And I think that's the first time that you've disclosed that information. So I guess what's the growth rate, profitability of those customers? And as you look at the millennial customer set, what's your assumption for how long they'll be customers with you? Since they're younger and you have more digital banking, do you now assume that they'll be with you, say, 20 years instead of 10 years? And if so, how do you change the price of products for that millennial customer set?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerOne of the things and I don't want to sound perspicacious in terms of people's views of big banks don't do big business with millennials, it's just to set the tone. We put the 16 million and give you $0.01. It's $400 billion of client balances with us. But if you look at our checking sales, Mike, and you look at the population representation of millennials in the population and Gen Z in a population, you look above 18 years old, and millennial is about 24% and people between 18 to 24 is 11%. But if you look at the rate we sell to that class of our sales to millennials, it's 40% of our sales. So it's basically 1.5 times the rate in the population we're selling to. And if you look at their holding and balances today, just pure checking, nothing -- not into savings or investment, the millennials hold about, I don't know, $70 billion of checking balances with us, and it's growing quickly. And so we are gaining share in that class. It's because of the digital capabilities and all things we talked about.Are they profitable? All our consumers basically are profitable. It represents a big part of our business today. The representation, they are currently outstanding. Checking accounts is about 40% just from millennials. So we're gaining a share in that segment. We've got to be on our toes at all times and it's very valuable. If you think -- you might have been around this business long time, you think about just those checking balances alone provide tremendous value. Will they stay with us? The answer is they have in the past, and we expect in the future as long as we keep driving the great experiences we have and going back to the comments on Page 6 to 8 of the slide deck on consumer strategies just look at the activity levels, and those are generally would have a stronger cohort to younger below 40-year old people. But on the other hand, across the platform, it wouldn't work. But if you look at it with Zelle, the activity volume, you can look at with Erica in a year, 50 million-plus customer interactions. And if you look at it in terms of digital interactions, that 2.3 billion in the quarter, mobile log-in is 1.5 billion, this is an advanced stage as anybody. And so we are very pleased with the team's work in this area. And then if you go to Merrill Edge, the -- if you look at the millennial balances, again, they represent twice the rate of the population. And we're accumulating those balances, which when we compare them to other competitors, 64% of our new clients are in the millennial categories for Merrill Edge and our preferred clients and things. So it's very good. We're driving it, but it's the competency of the team's capabilities in those categories that drive it.Mike Mayo-- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAnd the other question that I had, how long do you assume these customer to stay with you? And how does that compare to the past? And the reason I ask that, you look at some of the offers out there, and you get $400, $500, $600 simply for opening accounts in certain banks. The assumption is that once you get new customers, maybe they will stay with you longer than they would've, say, 10 years ago.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell, that goes back to your colleague's question about the rewards and things like that. Our preferred base of customers in the consumer business is a 99% plus retention rate. And so they really all stay with us, and so -- and that's extremely powerful dynamic. So the assumption I don't have it off the top of my head that the team puts in our models and stuff like that, but if you're retaining 99%, it's a pretty long duration.Mike Mayo-- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAll right. Thank you.OperatorWe'll take our next question from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.John McDonald-- Autonomous Research -- AnalystGood morning. The core loan growth continues to remain solid at 4%, Paul. Are you seeing some improved momentum in middle market and small business? And also the 2% reported is close some of that gap to that core number. I guess as you think about the rundown pace, could we continue to see a narrowing, so that your overall balance sheet growth looks closer to that core?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI guess, I'll do the second one first. The answer's yes. I mean we have $45 billion in the non-core portfolio. Of that $45 billion, half I would say is sort of legacy home equity and residential mortgages that will run off and/or depending on market conditions, we may see some more sales. The other half is mortgages that our previous Treasurer or CFO bought many years ago. It's -- they're good mortgages. They're going to run off as well. Together, they're running off at about $2 billion a quarter. So yes, I mean, you can just do the math. It's becoming a smaller, smaller component of the overall picture. And as you point out, look, when you look at our LOB's, they were up 4% year-over-year this quarter. And we are seeing, I think, good growth in small business. In fact, I think we're the largest lender to small business companies in the US now surpassing a competitor recently. We're seeing in middle market this quarter, we saw a pickup in growth that really complemented the consistent growth that we've been seeing for many quarters now from large global corporations. I mean we don't see anything on the horizon to suggest that we can't continue to grow kind of what we've been telling you, which is kind of the low to mid-single digits for the company from the business segments.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI'd just add two thoughts, though. One is Sharon Miller and our small -- runs our small business for us and a consumer business, and Alastair Borthwick runs middle market. They got their teams sort of moving along and as you said, growing at a consistent 5%, 6%, 7% depending on the product set, the type of -- whether real estate is lower versus core middle market, and so we feel very good about that. Remember that the runoff pace in the All Other book has been accelerated by the sales over the last few years and that was to reduce our potential credit risk and stress. And you've seen that we reflect it, including last year, asking for the extra capital return based on selling a bunch of loans during the year, which had higher charge-offs in the CCAR process as you might expect. And then secondly, operating risk of the company comes way down because those loans would have a tenancy, and we sell them servicing release. So we're getting to the bottom of the barrel. It's now 4% of the -- 5% of the portfolio. Used to be 8%, 9% of the total portfolio, maybe 10%, so we feel good about that impact really narrowing now. And the sales are largely -- we're always chipping away this quarter with a relatively modest balance, but the sales are largely through the money. And the stuff we have now is actually 12 years current pay and the thought that none of these loans were made since the crisis, so we feel good about that. And the last thing is think about in the Merrill side in terms of -- in the private banking side in terms of loan growth, we're seeing solid performance there. And the integration in middle-market investment banking, we feel good.John McDonald-- Autonomous Research -- AnalystGreat. Brian, I know you touched on this a little bit, but could you talk about your feelings or your ability to maintain the strong checking account growth that you had given the stance on rates paid? What's your outlook for that checking account growth to continue or maybe relative to GDP or to the industry?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerIf you look at it, we have maintained that pace. If you look at retail deposit growth since the beginning of '16, I think our growth -- the balances have grown about 20%. The peer group's grown about 12%, and so that's significant difference. We've been pretty consistent, growing $20-odd billion in checking. That is the core transaction account. So if you look at the -- what we're seeing now is the average balance in our checking accounts. I think there's $7.5 billion, $7 billion, $7.5 billion, $7.7 billion, something like that. 92% current, yet we're still for the -- in the last couple of years starting to net accumulate. And so we feel good that we can keep that checking balance growth. It's not dependent on rate paid because of the core transactional accounts. So even though there's some payment to interest-bearing checking, the dominant part is non-interest-bearing, and it's just the core transaction account. If you look in the money markets and stuff and see the rates, that's where the people get paid for the excess balances, but this is the money that's flowing through the household on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, and we feel very good about it and figure we can continue it because we have in all the environments and all the rate changes.John McDonald-- Autonomous Research -- AnalystGreat. Thank you.OperatorWe'll now go to Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystHey, good morning, guys. Couple of questions. First, I wanted to key in on something you said, Paul, on the rate sensitivity. You mentioned -- I know it's a crude approximation, but 25 basis point cut on the short end. It's $175 million a quarter. But that's just the banking book. And you're liability sensitive in your trading book, and I think you mentioned it's $100 million if you kind of net that out. So should we -- is my math right in suggesting that you get something in the neighborhood of a $75 million benefit per quarter for every 25 basis point cut in your trading book? Because obviously, in the past, sometimes, we've kind of looked at your NII growth and your NIM expansion in a rising rate environment. And maybe it hasn't grown as much as we thought because of the headwinds in the trading portfolio. But as short-term rates move down, should we see the opposite of that also occur and some of those headwinds get mitigated by expanded margins in your trading book?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, I think you're close. But the one piece you're missing is that in addition to being modestly liability sensitive in the trading book, when you look at those disclosures about the impact of 100 basis point shock on the downgrade scenario on the short end, remember, that's below the forward curve.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- Analystright.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSo you're looking -- you're literally talking about a scenario where short-end rates would be shot down to 75 basis points and long end would be at 1 percentage point. So the -- so that 3 billion obviously -- it gets -- you have more and more impact lower and lower rates go. That's first 20 basis points is not going to be 3 billion divided by 16. So you've got to factor in both of those things.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystNo, understood there, but is the logic right, I guess, is my question that you'll get an offset and that offset is sort of in that magnitude of, for every 25 basis point something in the neighborhood of $75 million on the trading book?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, I don't think we're prepared today to give so much guidance on how liability sensitive the trading book is. But when you put all the factors together, you kind of get to roughly 100 basis points -- I mean $100 million on that first rate cut.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystOkay.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerAnd remember, when I went through the script and talked about how that we still end up growing year-over-year, 2019 versus 2018, you've got to factor in loan and deposit growth. We've got the day coming in the quarter. So all those things impact it.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystAnd you're also baking in a little bit of a benefit, a little bit of an offset then from expanding margins and trading book on the rate cuts in that guidance?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah, in that guidance we're putting in a little bit, yeah.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- AnalystOkay. Changing gears. And apologize if I missed it, but did you disclose the size of the gain on the sale of the equity investment?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWe didn't disclose this -- the equity investment? Trading, yes. No, it was $200 million.Saul Martinez-- UBS -- Analyst$200 million. Okay, awesome. Thanks so much.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorWe'll now go to Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.Steven Chubak-- Wolfe Research -- AnalystHey, good morning. So wanted to start off with a question on the Investment Banking business. So it was pretty nice to see fee share increasing in the quarter. We had seen some share loss in some of the more recent quarters. I was hoping you could speak to some of the factors that maybe even driving some improved business momentum, whether it's leadership changes or anything else that you could attribute it to?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So just a quick review. Year-over-year, the market fees according to Dealogic were down, I think, 21%. Our reported fees were down only 4%. And if you look at Dealogic fees for us maybe 11%. So clearly, we picked up at least in this quarter meaningful, I would say, market share. I think this is a result of all the things that we said we were going to do, not that we ever had a problem in Investment Banking. But we think we should be top three, and there was a little bit of slippage there. And so we just reinvigorated the focus. We decided to add more bankers, particularly to cover the middle market. Remember, we have an army of corporate commercial bankers out there. They have great relationships. They've been making loans to clients for years and there's certainly an opportunity when those companies need to do something, need to use Investment Banking products for us to be there. We just needed to probably add a few more bankers dedicated to that segment. We've done that. We've got regional bankers now all around the US. We're going to be adding more. They're in the market with the commercial bankers. And that and I think just the reinvigoration from the leadership team across Global Corporate, Investment Bank and Commercial Bank and Business Banking, I just think is having an effect.Steven Chubak-- Wolfe Research -- AnalystGot it. Helpful color. And then, Paul, just one more for me, and it's on the topic of NII. I mean a slightly different tack. There's obviously pretty heavier lines across the industry on the 10-Q disclosures, which I know are inherently flawed. It's a very static snapshot. So maybe if you can speak to some of the factors that are driving more benign impact in terms of the rate sensitivity that you cited versus was explicitly disclosed in the 10-Q, whether it's volume growth, some issues relating to your comparing it versus the forward curve, deposit offsets or anything else you can speak to?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerJust one thing to be precise. Paul said a couple of times, but gets lost sometimes, and I'll let Paul get into the broader statement. When we disclose it, minus 100 basis points shocker down, 100 basis points across the curve, that is on top of what the forward curve has in it. And so sometimes people get confused by that because they think it's from the current rate -- stable rate environment we see today minus 100. It's actually in the case of forward curve having the rest of the year two cuts in it, it's 50 off and then another 100 off. And so that dynamic Paul's mentioned twice to sort of make sure people don't get ahead of us. But Paul can take you through the broader factors, but just be careful that you're not making that miscalculation, which we've seen other people do. We're not seeing you have, but other people have.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSure, look, I'm not sure what else I can add. I mean, if you think about our clients, right, you've got GWIM client and Global Banking clients where if rates change, the pass-through rate on those clients are going to be roughly the same up or down, right? And you've got consumer clients where because of the great job we've done on rate paid in the cycle, there just isn't a lot of room on the downside. But if rates go up, there's probably a little bit more pass-through. So that's the dynamic we're living with. On top of that, you've got to factor in when long-term interest rates go down. The quarter later or the month later, you're going to see an impact. That doesn't continue forever. It's only an impact when the rates go down, you get a live effect on some increase in write-off of premium, and so that's what's going on.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerPaul, just on that this quarter, a couple of basis points of the compression due to the amortization of the premium, which goes away next quarter if rates -- if the tenure doesn't fall by 50 basis points again during the quarter, so -- and another basis point sort of seasonality. So when Paul is talking about some of these sort of spot issues earlier on, of the 7 basis points, 3 of it is really just literally a quarterly effect that goes away. And that's where you think, as you think about it, go back to all the factors listed, loan growth, deposit growth, deposit pricing, loan pricing, but then the twist in the market when things change instantaneously can have a quarter effect and go away next quarter as long as rates don't move in the same velocity that they moved this quarter. And those are -- that's why that we are always careful about these estimates to make sure people understand the underlying basis. Now one of your colleagues said earlier the clue of this is we've got to grow loans and deposits. We grew $70 billion in deposits year-over-year. We've got $30-odd billion in loans. The rest of deposits go into securities. That is the core business, and that will drive the earnings power of this company and average earning asset growing, and that's what we're up to. That will ultimately make NII grow. The question is the twist and turns along the way can be a little different.Steven Chubak-- Wolfe Research -- AnalystVery helpful color, Brian. Thanks for taking my questions.OperatorOur next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerGood morning, Matt.Matthew D. O'Connor-- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystGood morning. You mentioned earlier about some puts and takes on the expenses and gave guidance for this year to be a little bit below what you have thought a few months ago. But what are your thoughts kind of beyond this year? I think at one point, you have said try to keep costs relatively flat at $53 billion. And then you did mentioned if I think you're alluding to, call it, capital markets-related or volume-related areas those were weaker, there is some levers to pull on cost. But if it's just a lower rate environment, is there other area on the cost side that you can pull in? So I guess question, kind of stable rate environment your base case, what are you thinking on costs and then if the revenue shortfall is just rate driven or there's some areas that you can tie in? Thanks.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo I think if you think about it over the last two years plus, I think we've ran around $13.1 billion, $13.2 billion, $13.3 billion in quarterly expenses. Except for one quarter, we had $13.8 billion, which was sort of the seasonality of strong markets quarter plus. It was the first quarter with the FICA and stuff like that. So basically, we got this thing at a run rate. And so -- but you've got to remember, in '19, that run rate has picked up. If you go back to when tax reform came through, we said we'd put $500 million more in the technology investment platform. A chunk of them ran through last year, and about $200 million or $300 million of it's run through this year. So that was increased expense. We said we did the share for success. We did over $1 billion in the 2 programs. There is a near-term cost to it and then there's an amortization of the deferred part, so there's stock. That's all in the P&L today. And then you have incentives, great rent and all the other stuff, the benefits. And with all that, we thought we'd be $53.2 billion, $53.3 billion this year.And Paul has told you basically to assume that we'd be closer to $53 billion with all that going on and all that extra investments. So if you go back to '16 when we said we're running at $50 billion -- I don't know, $57 billion or $56 billion, whatever we were, we told you we'd be $53 billion, low $53 billion. Nobody believed us. We got here. We've invested a lot more and we still are running at $53 billion. That is the inherent ability of the New BAC, SIM operational excellence, org health, which not -- doesn't mean a lot to all of you, but the teammates listening will understand all that, that allows us to keep driving the relative efficiency of the company. And even in environment where the world just kind of -- so it goes on, you have 2% growth. We know there's more we can do. What we don't want you to do is to get ahead of us because, frankly, the investment year-over-year in marketing was $150 million last year, second quarter this quarter, additional in the quarter. That won't sustain at that kind of level, but it's part of driving that customer satisfaction delight scores through the roof, which then means those -- the millennial accumulation accounts of twice the rate of population, which then turns into customers, to Mike's point, of the future that the digital comp still allows us to serve more efficiency, which then drives down the efficiency ratio. That is the operating model.And so those investments pay back, and they all were down to our benefit. But that said, we're saying we gave you a flattish from '18 to '19 to '20, and we're basically saying you don't push '20 down in your models because we will see what happens. But right now, we think '19 is going to come in a couple of hundred million under what we said, which just goes -- by the teammates here is good management. We didn't do anything. We didn't pull any lever. We just kept driving the basic efficiency of this platform through and we'll continue to do that.And if that comes in to be lower than the number we're talking about for '20 and we get there, it's going to go to you. But importantly, as we shouldn't change our investment strategy, our belief and our Board's belief and our shareholders' belief, frankly, is don't change your investment strategy because, right now, you're seeing the market share accumulations come that you wouldn't change to pick up expenses by $100 million in the quarter. $0.01 wouldn't make good, but the investments are long-term strategic drives that are happening. And just on the investment banking, adding 50 middle-market investment bankers and adding -- doubling that again over the next couple of years are paying us back.Matthew D. O'Connor-- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, that's helpful. And then just separately, the CCAR ask and approval impressive $30 billion as you mentioned earlier, do you plan to use all of that? And should we assume the timing if you do apparently you use all that is spread even or do you have the flexibility to front end if you wanted to?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes, we plan to use all of it and it's spread equally over the quarters under the way the method works and the sort of the guidance they gave you. So it's spread evenly over the four quarters, and yes, we plan to use 100% of them.Matthew D. O'Connor-- Deutsche Bank -- AnalystOkay, thank you.OperatorWe'll now go to Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open.Kenneth Usdin-- Jefferies -- AnalystThanks. Good morning, guys. Brian, you mentioned in your opening remarks just how strong credit is and expected to continue and you guys have talked about charge-offs kind of living in the $900 million to $1 billion range a quarter. We went under that even this quarter. So can you just talk about is there any reason why we should see any change in this kind of $900-ish million run rate even with card losses or barely even moving as is? Just an update on what you're expecting would be great. Thank you.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerI'll let Paul hit that one just because he talked about it. Go ahead, Paul.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSo you're right. Net charge-offs were lower than $1 billion this quarter, but that's because we wrote back up charge-offs we took earlier associated with the loans we sold this quarter. So if you backed that out, it's approximately $1 billion of net charge-off. And that number we think is a good number, approximately that number. It'll bounce around because we're bouncing around the bottom and commercial. So one commercial client or another can always move things, but it's been $1 billion now or up to $1 billion now for many, many, many quarters. And if we see the -- if we think the environment stays the way it is, that's what we think it's going to be and then provision will follow that.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerAnd when you think about it, cards the number, right? And if you look at our live charge-off rate because sometimes growth -- we're basically consistent with our current charge-off rates, so the stable portfolio, stable credit. At the end of the day, it's 80%, 90% of all the activity, and you've seen that basically be fairly consistent. And this year is the lowest increase in Card year-over-year since 2013. So that prime focused book, that primary customer account basis through the combined rewards is probably going to lead to a very, very strong customer base there. So we feel good about credit, and our view of the economy is it continues to move along in the low to mid-twos. That's what the research team has and then next year, around 2%. And given that, we would not see a change.Kenneth Usdin-- Jefferies -- AnalystOkay, got it. My second question is just on the preferred stack, you guys did some issuance, and I think some either pending or calls. Can you just talk about just at least where you expect the preferred dividend to lend going forward? And is there a more opportunities to refinance that part of the capital stack?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, we never really like to talk about plan stuff. But in terms of the preferred stack, we're going to end up roughly the same place where we started because we're just reducing the cost of that preferred stack by calling some higher yielding preferreds in place of lower-yielding preferreds. So in terms of the dividends in the first quarter and the third quarter, we're kind of approximately in the 440 range and in the second quarter and the fourth quarter we're kind of in the 240 range. That could fluctuate a little bit because it's based upon -- some of them are based upon floating rates. But on the other hand, some of those get forward after a while as well.Kenneth Usdin-- Jefferies -- AnalystGot it, OK. Thank you.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThanks.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is open.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerMorning, Gerard.Gerard Cassidy-- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystGood morning, guys. How are you? Paul, I may have missed this. I apologize if you addressed it already. Can you share with us how you're managing the CET1 ratio with the stress capital buffer that may now be included in next year's CCAR? Have you guys run the numbers? And what is your CET1 ratio comes out under the SEB?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerWell, our CET1 ratio and our ratio right now is 9.5. And we don't know what the final rule's going to be yet. But if you look at the past four years and you run using those scenarios, CCAR scenarios, our SEB would be below the 2.5% floor in three of the last four years. And that's just a reflection of responsible growth and how we run the company. We've got loans to consumer that are prime and super-prime. We have very prudent trading, and we've got a legacy portfolio that's running off. So we're below, we've been below for three out of the last four years.Lee McEntire-- Senior Vice President, Investor RelationsAnd to be clear, this is Lee. What Paul said, our CET1 was 11.7% and our minimum requirement, which is what he was referring to is the 9.5%.Gerard Cassidy-- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystVery good. And then, Brian, I know you had talked about the economy from what the research has said at Merrill Lynch, but can you share with us what your business customers are saying to you about their outlook? Obviously, the consumer numbers speak for themselves. We all see the employment numbers, which are very strong, but what are you guys seeing both in small business and midsized and larger businesses?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerSo the core loan growth is strong. The usage of lines is good. It's running near the high levels and stuff, so the activity is there. I'd say that, depending on the type of commercial customer, the more they're in the global trade international supply chain, whatever words, the more they have. China has slowed down. If that's 20% of the business, they're dealing with that. But they're all sanguine. They all feel good. They all would wish the discussions of trade would come to a resolution and reestablish their relationships and the flows because the fact of the current impact is one thing, the fact that the belief that there's future impact. So I'd say they're optimistic. They're struggling to get people because that's the thing we're lacking in the US, especially. They see their business plans not being as robust as they were in '18, but still solid growth, but they continue to watch the headlines daily, trying to figure out if these situations are resolved. And I think there's pent-up enthusiasm if these situations start to fall in place that you'll hear more investment in business and things like that. On the other hand, there are -- the indications in our surveys about their confidence are basically more consistent where they were as they were coming up to the peaks they hit in '18 right after tax reform, i.e., where they were in '17. So they've kind of come down a little bit, but the levels are as high as anytime they've been, other than -- there's tremendous business enthusiasm came out of the year in '17 and early '18 between regulatory reform and tax. That has been mitigated by the trade discussions and uncertainty around them. But overall, they're solid. And I think they're sort of waiting for this to resolve and then they'll get back and they'll push back and accelerate again. Right now, they're staying within the speed limits to say that.Gerard Cassidy-- RBC Capital Markets -- AnalystThank you.OperatorAnd we'll now go to Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Your line is open.Brian Kleinhanzl-- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. -- AnalystGreat, thanks. Yeah just a quick question on the NII sensitivity that you gave. What were the deposit beta assumptions behind those? Are you being conservative? Just trying to get a sense there.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerSure. So again, the way to think about it, and I'll give you a little bit more detail, but just to get the concept down, we've got GWIM clients, we've got Global Banking clients that pass-through rate on an up-and-down scenario of roughly similar, and we've got a consumer franchise where we have not passed through a lot of rate increase in the former rate paid. That's obviously going to have a different sensitivity in the up scenario than in the down scenario. That's just the basics. So if you look at the pass-through rate and the down scenario an average we're talking approximately 40%, and again, consumer would be a lot lower, GWIM and Global Banking would be a lot higher kind of in 60%, 65% range.Brian Kleinhanzl-- Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. -- AnalystOkay, great. Thanks.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorAnd we'll now go to Kevin St Pierre with KSP Research. Please go ahead.Kevin St. Pierre-- KSP Research -- AnalstHi, good morning. Thanks. Going back to the mobile and digital trends that you're obviously really strong, but looking backwards over the last several quarters, your tax spend has been pretty flat, and you mentioned that tax spend is likely to increase. It's that a reinvestment constant investment in the mobile and digital channels?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerYes. We've been consistent. It's been -- I think what I said is we elevated tax spend after tax savings and then we've been relatively consistent. One of the things I'd say that we're receiving a benefit as you think about that number, if you think about the combinations of money spent on Brexit, broker-dealer separation for resolution planning and a bunch of other initiatives like that, we can reposition that money more toward op ends over time, and that's been good. And as we look forward to the next couple of years, a flat number would actually provide more pop, for lack of a better term, and our teammates are always happy to hear that. But these things are impacts that compound. And so I'll give you an example. If you look at digital mortgage, which the $3 billion were digitally originated this quarter of the 18, so it's growing. But it took us a year -- a little over a year to do the first $1 billion. It took us eight weeks to do the second $1 billion. It took us six weeks to do the third $1 billion. So what happens with these implementations is -- the technology investments made and then it ramps up. And what's really happening in digital mortgage, remember, is it's actually saving us a lot of money in the origination process as well as be a good client experience. And so you take that or take Erica, which is now moved to several million customers, you can see 50 million interactions first year. But each month, it's growing. Business -- small businesses went out, and it's going at 50% a week type of numbers, even though we haven't told people it's out there and things like that. And so now growing $100 billion year-over-year. Checks written are coming down more effectively. All this really points to the compounding effect of that digitization. So that consistent investment renders benefits two, three, five years out, and that's what we're driving at. So we'll be consistent in our investment. There's only so much you can do. We do about 1 million lines of coding every weekend and conversion, so to speak. And there's -- you've got to be careful you don't have a problem, and we've -- knock on wood. Cathy and the team have done a great job, and we haven't seen any issues that we've implemented tremendous new codes, so to speak, over the course of years here. And so we are bound more by what we can get done and getting the benefits out of it than we are by money.Kevin St. Pierre-- KSP Research -- AnalstGreat. And I noticed the digital appointment continue to grow really strongly. Are you at a point where and I noticed that sort of year-over-year and sequentially, your financial center numbers are pretty stable. Can we assume that the foot traffic that's being driven you make sure you think you're at right critical mass of financial centers? Or can we expect over time continued consolidation and rationalization there?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWe'll see the numbers not be as dramatic from the 6,100 to the 4,300 obviously, but it's a complete distribution system. So the ATMs have gone up from 16,000 up to, I think, 18,000 or something number now. Rates have come down. The branches are completely different. They're bigger. They have more people in them. People go to them because of more complex needs, et cetera, versus take the transaction side, take the check and deposit. So we're driving more co-location. But if you think about the real interesting news is, remember, at the end of the day, we have the number one retail deposit share in the United States. We're growing faster than anybody else, but we're still not in several markets in the top 30 markets and that's what we're building out, whether it's Indianapolis, whether it's the Minneapolis, whether it's Denver, whether it's now Cincinnati, Columbus. And we are in Pittsburgh, and there's many other cities in the top 30 and top 50 that we have to figure out how we drive a configuration against them over the next piece of time here. So the actual branch count may have different elements than you would have thought going back to the constant down. But you see it drift down a little bit net, net, net because even in major cities, the consolidation of branches into bigger enterprises or co-location with Merrill teammates or Business Banking teammates or small business teammates and private banking teammates is part of the drive. So don't get so focused on that. What I would get focused on is actually the cost of operating the platform. And if you look at that year-over-year, it fell by 4 basis points as a percent of deposits. That is phones. That is everything. And if you think about that, if you add that in the cost of deposit rate paid, you're basically flat year-over-year in total cost of goods sold, for lack of a better term, to produce this wonderful transaction franchise and consumer. And then you throw the loans franchise on top of it and the investment franchise on top of that, it is a powerful engine, but it's a combination of everything that we -- that I just talked about, not five less branches or four less this.Kevin St. Pierre-- KSP Research -- AnalstGreat. Thanks very much.OperatorAnd we'll now go to Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Your line is open.Vivek Juneja-- JP Morgan Chase & Co. -- AnalystHi, thanks for taking the questions. A couple of questions. Firstly, since there was -- you pointed out, Brian and Paul, a couple of times about making sure that we take account of the fact that your NII guidance is based on over and above the forward curve. So let's step back given that, that may not be as realistic or likely to happen. What is the outlook for NII if the forward curve is realized when you look over 12-month period? I know you've given us second half, but just these things are not linear. Can you give us a sense of what would that be on NII -- what would NII do with the forward curve being realized?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI'm not sure, I quite follow your question, Vivek. But just to be very clear...Vivek Juneja-- JP Morgan Chase & Co. -- AnalystSorry, go ahead.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThe asset sensitivity of the company, those disclosures that you read in the Q, that is in excess of the forward curve. When we were talking about earlier in this call somebody asked about what was the next 25 basis points, and we went through what we thought the impact of that was.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerRight, and I think Paul's statements early in the prepared remarks are exactly what you're saying, which is stable rates and follow the forward curve with the rest of '19. He gave you the 3 billion to 2% goes to 1% growth '18 to '19.Vivek Juneja-- JP Morgan Chase & Co. -- AnalystRight. Right. Now, you've give that for '19. And I might guess asking for a fuller 12 months rather than just simply the second half, Brian.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWell, we said as we watch what happens over the next few months we can do better. We'll have a better view of giving you '19 or '20, excuse me, but you think of the run rate exiting '19 at that level, and you can add two more quarters to it. But loan growth, deposit growth, whether the cut comes, when it comes, those are all factors in there. So I think Paul said, we'll talk about that next quarter when we know a little bit more.Vivek Juneja-- JP Morgan Chase & Co. -- AnalystOkay, OK. So let's move to another one. Residential mortgage loan growth accelerated sharply this quarter far more than we've seen in the last couple of years, actually probably in dollar mark double of what you've seen in any quarter, and that's despite lower rates and more refi. So are you holding onto some conforming? Or is there such a sharp increase in jumbos?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWe have held old mortgages for six, seven years now.Vivek Juneja-- JP Morgan Chase & Co. -- AnalystEven the conforming?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWe sell the -- we basically sell the FHA, VA, that and everything else that goes on a balance sheet because, frankly, the risk in our mortgage portfolio isn't worth passing to someone to take the risk away from us. And so the increase is just due to purely the origination platform. Basically went from $8 billion last year second quarter to $18 billion this quarter, maybe $9 billion last quarter -- year. So that all goes on and increases the growth rate. And then we're not also in the aggregate sense. Remember, we're not selling as much out of the portfolio and the current environment, but we have not sold mortgages to the secondary market for years, other than the FHA, VA product.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerRemember we're focused on prime and super-prime. These are our customers. We feel good about the risk.Vivek Juneja-- JP Morgan Chase & Co. -- AnalystOkay. Got it. One tiny detail. Trade rev gain I know $200 million was the amount you gave. Is that included in other income? Or is that actually in trading?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThat was not included in the external sales and trading numbers that we presented in the -- apparently discussed today, and presented in the materials. It's in other income in Global Markets. So it's in the revenue, but not in sales and trading.Vivek Juneja-- JP Morgan Chase & Co. -- AnalystOkay, great. Thank you.Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerThank you.OperatorWe'll now go to Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Please go ahead.Andrew Lim-- Societe Generale -- AnalystHi, thanks for taking my questions. I'm just looking for a bit more color on the net interest -- sorry, the deposit side in terms of mix and rates. So this is related to Slide 9. So we see here net interest-bearing deposits struggling to grow. Interest-bearing deposits growing quite nicely, and that's very much emanating to what's going on in the Global Banking side. So just wondering if you can talk a bit more about competitive dynamics as to why it's a bit more difficult to grow your non-interest-bearing deposits, especially on the Global Banking side? And then my second question is relating to the interest-bearing deposit side. So if we look to the supplement and the interest rate paid that's gone up by 4 basis points, could you talk about what's driving that it sounds like the beat is going up there? And then how would you expect that to develop in a declining rate environment? And then my third question is that your interest rate guidance and on the yield, is that based on a static deposit mix? Or do you think into accounts some further mix shifts as we've seen there?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerOkay. Well, let's start with non-interest-bearing deposits, and you'll have to help me remember your questions as we go through here. So on non-interest-bearing deposits, we are growing non-interest-bearing deposits in consumer. We're growing low interest tracking in consumer. Those are -- that's really where you find conceptually the non-interest-bearing deposits on the company. In Global Banking, we have interest-bearing deposits and non-interest-bearing deposits. But remember, we're paying ECR on the non-interest-bearing deposits. The -- as interest rates rise, corporations that we're very comfortable leaving excess funds in their non-interest-bearing account when rates were lower, they just get a little bit more careful, and they only leave what in their non-interest-bearing accounts what they need to do their transactions. Think about it as like the daily sort of transactions that those clients need to do. And any excess liquidity they're probably pushing into non-interest-bearing plus outside the US, they don't really have the concept of non-interest-bearing and interest-bearing. It's all interest-bearing. So what you should focus on is the fact that we grew deposits in Global Banking 12% year-over-year, that reflects the sophistication and value we're bringing clients from that treasury services platform, and it reflects the bankers we've added and the relationships that they have in the US and around the world, 12% growth in a kind of is going at 2% feels good to us. So that's I went into the first question. What was the second question?Andrew Lim-- Societe Generale -- AnalystThe rates on your interest-bearing deposits. As we look to your supplement disclosure then I think we're looking at US interest-bearing deposits the rate they're going up 4 basis points from 73 to 77?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. I mean that is probably just reflects the mix shift that we've just been talking about in Global Banking. And there wasn't a lot of increase other than maybe a little bit of exception pricing in consumer. GWIM, I think, was relatively flat. And in Global Banking when you have a mix shift, you're going to see since more deposits are going in to the interest-bearing, you're going to see an increase in the overall deposit rate of the company.Andrew Lim-- Societe Generale -- AnalystAnd would you expect that mix shift to continue going forward?Paul M. Donofrio-- Chief Financial OfficerI don't know if it's going to continue. It depends on the rate environment.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerRemember, it really is a question of looking at the different businesses because consumers had checking grow 41 consecutive quarters. So you should expect the trends there to continue like we said earlier in our call. With the institutional business, the Global Banking business, as rates move, you saw a movement. And then that movement will stabilize as rates stabilize. Or if they come down, you actually see the thing come back the other way a little bit. And if you look in the wealth management, it's sort of halfway between. And you have to then think about the use of cash, some as transactional, some as investment oriented, i.e. they're trying to get a yield on it and where people put money depends on that and that becomes more exacerbated, more prevalent in the wealthier part of the consumer client base than in obviously institutional client base. So we do use -- when we make our estimates, I think it was the third part of your question, we estimate mix as deposits, deposit growth by categories, deposit growth by business line and we think of all that. And all that's factored in into the question Paul -- discussion Paul had with you. I hate -- I don't want to be stubborn here, but you've got to remember that you back up and think about it. $70 billion of deposit growth, all at a hugely advantaged cost of funds, all the core customers is what we drive in this -- in one part of our business here. That is a tremendous impact. And half of it from the consumer side and then $20 billion in checking in our own -- in our consumer deposit segment. These are massive growth engines that exceed the size of many institutions.Andrew Lim-- Societe Generale -- AnalystThat's great. Thanks very much.OperatorAnd our last question today is a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.Mike Mayo-- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystHi. Your AOCI, I guess, it got better by what, $2.5 billion linked quarter. So that's good. You guided for lower NII growth this year. Investors don't necessarily like that. So I guess I'm asking you, this environment with lower interest rates, I know investors don't like guidance, lower or spread revenues, but how do you think about it? Because while you have lower guidance for spread revenues. You also have better values of those securities, better AOCI, better capital and better book value. So when you look at that trade-off, how do you think about it? Do you think on monetizing from those securities gains? Do you get as worried as investors you say, hey, this is fine. You look at the economic value of the firm. We're not paying attention to a few basis points here or there.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWe look at the long term, Mike, as you're well aware. And going back to your earlier question, so we always look at what the most efficient use of all the dynamics you talked about, but we're not here to trade the balance sheet. We're here to let the customer activity come through it and then optimize that for the shareholder, but -- and so the AOCI came up this quarter. People always forget about that. That's the offset to the NII debate with lower rates going forward is the current long-term securities you have are worth more. We invest every quarter about half treasuries and half mortgage-backed, and those treasuries are now advantaged when -- from the last whatever period of time. And so we don't try to say let's try to get a $0.01 here, as you said, because at the end of the day, we're driving that long-term value of the franchise. So I think the spirit of your question is do you manage a company for the long-term value. The answer is absolutely yes. And are we mindful of trying to optimize things on a given day, month, week, quarter? Yes. But the reality is, is that we always make the decision for long-term value of the company. And the real solve here that you've referenced is our capital keeps growing even though we're returning 100% of it and we have an excess for many of the constraints in the CCAR, that is tens of billions of dollars and we're going to return part of that. That's driven by how we run the company for the last decade, not how we ran it this week, and we're getting the payback for that.Mike Mayo-- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAnd then last follow-up. Just the total discussion where interest rates assumes that maybe we're going to head into recession, maybe activity slowing down, you have better data that we have. So what's your read on the economy? What's your overall read just on being conditions for you to do business?Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerWe don't see any condition. If you think of the US economy, it's two-thirds driven by the consumers. And if you think about the employment levels, the job counts, you think about the wage growth, you think about the wage growth in our firm, which exceeds the national averages by 2 and 3 times. A lot of my peers I talked to, not only in our industry, outside it, that wages or pay of their teammates are much higher. They are sharing the benefits of the success. We do not see anything that says the US consumer in our business is spending 5% more plus than they did last year for the second quarter. It has grown first quarter, second quarter, i.e it's accelerating, and we -- and they're borrowing and in good shape. We don't see anything consistent with a recession. What we can see is just consistent with a 2%-plus growth rate versus a 3% growth rate, largely due to the impacts of some of the benefits of tax reform, other things running through the economy last year. And so we feel very -- it's very solid. And so yes, there's a slowdown, but that slowdown was predicted by everybody. And now you're seeing it evident. But you're actually seeing it pick up a little bit in the consumer side from first quarter to second quarter, and we'll see how that plays out, Mike.Mike Mayo-- Wells Fargo Securities -- AnalystAll right. Thank you.OperatorWe have no further questions at this time. It is now my pleasure to turn our call back over to Brian Moynihan for closing remarks.Brian Moynihan-- Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive OfficerThank you very much for your time and your interest in our company. We had a strong quarter of record earnings. We have continue to manage it the right way. Growing responsibly by driving customer growth, by managing the risk well and by investing in a franchise on a sustainable basis. We'll continue to do that. We're monitoring the environment is the question that Mike just said in terms of focused on, any condition we see what we have to change the operating model, but we continue to deliver good share of value and plan to push the capital back to you that comes off this wonderful franchise that we have.

The defendants are: UBS Financial Services Inc, UBS Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co LLC; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc; RBC Capital Markets LLC, and Santander Securities LLC.MBIA argued that these underwriters failed to do their due diligence on Puerto Rico bonds, which led to disclosures that were ""materially false or misleading"" and upon which its unit, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, relied upon when it decided to insure the debt.A request for comment from J.P. Morgan was not immediately answered. Representatives of the other banks declined to comment on the lawsuit.National insured more than $11 billion of Puerto Rico debt. Subsequent defaults led the insurer to make as of July 1 over $720 million in claims payments that the lawsuit seeks to recover in damages from the banks.The same banks were sued by Puerto Rico's federally created fiscal oversight board in May for allegedly aiding and abetting the island's ""clearly insolvent"" government to issue debt.","FundamentalAnalysis,Stocks,401k,BankingandLoans,Retirement,Bonds","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Quidel (QDEL) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/quidel-qdel-q2-2019-earnings-call-transcript-cm1195425', '_id': {'$oid': '5d4d25f683ce45146291a079'}}, {'news_title': 'Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/keurig-dr-pepper-kdp-q2-2019-earnings-call-transcript-cm1195426', '_id': {'$oid': '5d4d25f683ce45146291a07a'}}, {'news_title': 'OGE Energy (OGE) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/oge-energy-oge-q2-2019-earnings-call-transcript-cm1195427', '_id': {'$oid': '5d4d25f683ce45146291a07b'}}]","{'$date': '2019-08-08T16:56:00Z'}"

The company is expected to report EPS of $0.68, up 3.03% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $22.14 billion, down 2.8% from the year-ago period.BAC's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $2.83 per share and revenue of $91.06 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +8.43% and -0.2%, respectively.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for BAC. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves.

This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 10.47.We can also see that BAC currently has a PEG ratio of 1.05. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

bank's bottom line. But digging deeper, there was good news

performance for the three months ended September 30th.A full transcript follows the video.The next billion-dollar iSecret

.Gaby Lapera:

Do you want to talk a little bit about Bank of America?John Maxfield:

Yeah. As listeners may know, and people who read my writing, I
follow Bank of America pretty closely and write quite a bit
about them. What I found so interesting from this quarter was a
point that CEO and Chairman Brian Moynihan stressed on the
quarterly conference call. It was the fact that, did Bank of
American have an incredible quarter? No.I think its return on equity for the quarter was 0.82%, when
you want a bank to be 1% or higher on its return on assets. It
didn't have a great quarter, looking at it as a snapshot.
However, if you couple it up with the three previous quarters,
building it out to a full year although it's straddling
2014/2015, it was the first time since the financial crisis
that Bank of America generated a solid profit for four quarters
in a row.This builds on what we talked about last quarter when Bank
of America reported. It looks to me like Bank of America has
really turned the corner, finally, and put the majority of
those liabilities that were weighing on its earnings that
relate to financial crisis, has put those in the rearview
mirror.Now, that doesn't mean that tomorrow Bank of America will be
generating 1.5% returns on assets. What it does mean is that
you're probably going to see consistent profitability for the
most part going forward, and those profitability metrics are
probably relatively consistently going to edge up. That's a
good thing for shareholders in Bank of America, and for
prospective investors because it still trades for a substantial
discount to book value.Lapera:

This is also a really good sign for future economic growth for
the entire country.Maxfield:

Yeah. That's a really good point. When you think about what
dictates economic growth, it's a function of three things -- at
least the way economists think about it -- it's a function of
labor, capital, and productivity. If you increase any one of
those, holding all else equal, you're going to increase your
economic growth.Banks are so important because they increase capital. They
don't actually create capital, but they aggregate the savings
of the millions of Americans spread around the country who put
a little bit of money into their savings account and then banks
put all that together and lend it out for people who want to
buy houses, which pushes economic growth, or corporations who
want to make business investments pushes economic growth.Banks really stand at the narrows in terms of economic
growth. When you have Bank of America, which is your largest
consumer bank in the country, still ailing from the financial
crisis and is thereby not able to grow its portfolio as quickly
as it wants to, that's really going to impact your economic
growth.Even more generally than bank earnings, Bank of America and
Citigroup

's recovery is a very, very positive and important thing
for the United States economy.The article

Bank of America

(NYSE: BAC) just closed the door on yet another chapter in its
post-financial crisis history.The nation's second-biggest bank by assets
said

on Tuesday that it's shuttering its legacy assets and servicing
(LAS) division, which had been formed in the wake of the crisis
to house the bank's toxic mortgage-related assets and noncore
businesses.Beginning with the second quarter, Bank of America will now
report results in four business segments: consumer banking,
global wealth and investment management, global banking, and
global markets. It also reports results from an ""All Other""
segment that handles enterprisewide issues such as asset and
liability management.Data source: Bank of America. Chart by author.For lack of a better term, LAS was Bank of America's bad bank,
quarantined from the rest of its operations both to illuminate
the strength of its healthy operations and to concentrate
authority around the task of cleaning up its unhealthy
operations.Citigroup

used a similar strategy to isolate its own crisis-related
problems, forming Citi Holdings and reporting its results
separately from Citicorp.At its peak, in the second quarter of 2012, Bank of America's
LAS unit employed the equivalent of 41,800 full-time employees.
And since being carved off from the bank's other units in 2011,
it has recorded a total of $44 billion in net losses.YearLAS Net Loss2015$740 million2014$13.1 billion2013$5.1 billion2012$7.3 billion2011$17.9 billionData source: Bank of America's regulatory filings.The one downside to the move from the perspective of investors
and analysts is that it makes it more difficult to seamlessly
track the trajectory of Bank of America's progress since the
crisis -- which was already a challenge given that the LAS
segment had previously been realigned once following its 2011
debut.This aside, this is positive news for Bank of America's
shareholders. Over the last two years in particular, the North
Carolina-based bank has made obvious strides in its efforts to
distance itself from the financial crisis.Its once-unconscionable legal liabilities have now largely
been slayed. It has reduced annual operating expenses by $15
billion since 2011. And last year it redirected its focus to
generating revenue as opposed to simply cutting costs.This doesn't mean that Bank of America is back to firing on
all cylinders. The question now is whether it can earn its cost
of capital in the absence of higher interest rates. I'm skeptical
that it'll be able to do so, but, given that Bank of America is
my largest stock holding, I look forward to be proven wrong.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

Wall Street is calling for earnings of $0.38 per share, up from $0.28 during the same period last year. The stock has gained 34.8% over the last twelve months.BAC was recently trading at $22.69, just $0.70 below its 12-month high and $11.70 above its 12-month low. Overall technical indicators for BAC are bullish with a strong upward trend. The stock has recent support above $21.75, and recent resistance below $23.40. Of the 19 analysts who cover the stock, 11 rate it a ""strong buy"", three rate it a ""buy"", and five rate it a ""hold"". The stock receives S&P Capital IQ's 4 STARS ""Buy"" ranking.Like all of the major bank stocks, Bank of America has enjoyed strong gains over the last two months. Between Trump's victory in the presidential election, and the Federal Reserve finally moving to lift rates, expectations are high that the financial sector will continue to strengthen in 2017. BAC is now trading near its 52-week high, but its valuation remains attractive with a P/E of 16.6. Analysts forecast that earnings will rise 12.3% in 2017, but if we see one or more interest rate increases though the course of 2017, earnings growth will be sharply higher than what has already been priced into the stock, and given the current valuation there is a good chance that BAC will build on its recent gains. The Street has a whisper number of $0.39, which is a penny above the consensus, and if the company is able to hit that number the stock should gap higher and rise to a new 52-week high.If you want a bullish hedged trade on the stock, consider a March 15/20 bull-put credit spread for a 25-cent credit. That's a potential 5.3% return (27.4% annualized*) and the stock would have to fall 10.8% to cause a problem.If you want to take a bearish stance on the stock at this time, consider a February 25/28 bear-call credit spread for a $0.30 credit. That's a potential 11.1% return (96.6% annualized*) and the stock would have to rise 11.5% to cause a problem.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.Originally published on InvestorsObserver.com","Investing,Options","BAC","[{'news_title': 'CDW Breaks Below 200-Day Moving Average - Notable for CDW', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/cdw-breaks-below-200-day-moving-average-notable-for-cdw-cm944960', '_id': {'$oid': '5ac81d803efc2c4179871ebe'}}, {'news_title': 'Bank of the Ozarks (OZRK) Shares Cross Below 200 DMA', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/bank-of-the-ozarks-ozrk-shares-cross-below-200-dma-cm944916', '_id': {'$oid': '5ac81d803efc2c4179871ebf'}}, {'news_title': 'All 30 Dow Stocks End Lower on China Trade Turmoil', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/all-30-dow-stocks-end-lower-on-china-trade-turmoil-cm944935', '_id': {'$oid': '5ac81d803efc2c4179871ec0'}}]","{'$date': '2017-01-07T07:52:49Z'}"

Berkshire Hathaway

made a substantial investment in
Bank of America

in 2011. In his most recent letter to shareholders, Buffett
spoke favorably about this investment and its future in
Berkshire's portfolio. Here's why Buffett might like Bank of
America as a long-term investment, and why you may want to put
the bank on your radar, too.Buffett's commentary on Bank of America



As a result of this investment, Berkshire has the option to buy
700 million shares of the bank for $5 billion any time before
September 2021, and also owns $5 billion of Bank of America 6%
cumulative perpetual preferred stock.First of all, whatever decisions Berkshire Hathaway makes
with its Bank of America investment from here on out, it's
already been a big winner. Buffett's option to buy 700 million
shares works out to a share price of just $7.14, a 47% discount
to the bank's current price of $13.50 as of this writing. In
other words, Buffett can buy $9.2 billion worth of stock for $5
billion.Additionally, Buffett was able to negotiate a deal directly
with Bank of America's management that you or I could never
get. Berkshire Hathaway's total price for the preferred stock
and

the options to buy 700 million shares was just $5 billion.
Effectively, Buffett paid face value for the preferred stock
and received the warrants (options) for free. Keep in mind that
at the time of the deal, Bank of America shares traded for just
over $8.00, so the warrants didn't have much intrinsic value
yet, but it was still a great deal for Buffett.Regardless of Berkshire's special deal, the important thing
to investors like you and me is Buffett's thoughts on the
future of this investment. In his letter to shareholders,
Buffett said that Berkshire is likely to purchase these shares
just before the expiration of the option, and could possibly
sell its preferred stock in order to fund the purchase. He also
specifically said that Bank of America is an investment that
Berkshire values highly.This is extremely significant, because if Berkshire wasn't
optimistic about Bank of America's merits as a long-term
investment at its current price, it could simply exercise its
options now and sell the shares, pocketing an easy $4.2 billion
profit.A much-improved bank that's still cheap



Bank of America has come a long way since the financial crisis.
As my colleague John Maxfield pointed out in a
recent article

, 2015 was the first year in nearly a decade that the bank
produced significant profits for four consecutive quarters. In
fact, the bank's net income of almost $16 billion was
by far

its best performance in recent history.Plus, the bank is much more stable in terms of its ability
to absorb another recession or crash. The bank's capital levels
are well above the threshold of a ""well capitalized"" bank,
which should allow the bank to increase its dividend payment
and/or its buyback program when the Federal Reserve's
comprehensive capital analysis and review (CCAR) process is
completed in June.And speaking of buybacks, this is the best possible way that
Bank of America can put its profits to work for shareholders,
and for the same reason I think the bank is a buy right now --
it's cheap. Even after the recent rebound in bank stocks, Bank
of America trades for a 12% discount to the value of its
tangible assets. In other words, by repurchasing its stock,
Bank of America can effectively buy back its own assets at
$0.88 on the dollar, creating instant value for
shareholders.My point here is that, even though the bank is much more
responsible and well-capitalized than it was just a few years
ago, this fact isn't reflected in the share price. In fact,
even after the rebound, you'd have to go back to 2012 to find
today's valuation.Image source: YCharts.Granted, there are some risks facing the bank. For example,
Bank of America has $21.3 billion in outstanding loans to
energy companies, and if low 
oil
prices

persist, we could see a wave of defaults. And, the persistent
low interest environment has made it difficult for all banks to
grow their net interest margin.Should you jump in?



Despite the risks, I feel that Bank of America's progress and
its low valuation more than make up for them. Buffett obviously
feels that Bank of America is attractively valued at its
current price; otherwise he could sell his warrants and move
on. Even after the latest rebound, Bank of America is still an
attractive long-term investment, and one that you may want to
consider for your portfolio while it's still so cheap.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

money.



The financial behemoth opened higher, and the option action hit
almost immediately as traders took positions in the short-term
weekly calls that expire this Friday. optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker
program shows that activity was initially focused on the 12.50
calls, which were bought early for $0.10 to $0.12.



Those
long calls

lock in the price where the stock can be purchased no matter how
high it might rise. Because they are relatively inexpensive, the
options can generate significant leverage if the stock moves. And
move it did.



BAC paused briefly, but then press reports indicated that the bank
would settle a legal dispute with bond insurer MBIA. That gave the
shares a second wind, pushing them up 5.23 percent to $12.88 by the
end of the session.



The Weekly 12.50 calls more than tripled to $0.41--not bad for a
few hours work! More than 56,000 contracts changed hands, compared
with previous open interest of 33,441 at the strike.



Investors piled into the Weekly 13 calls later in the session,
eventually buying more than 100,000 contracts. Premiums surged from
just $0.01 to $0.13.



Total option volume was quadruple the daily average, with calls
accounting for more than four-fifths of the total.

is a massive and complex institution, but that doesn't mean
analyzing the company's fundamentals has to be all that
difficult. To prove it, let's break down the company's income
statement with just two simple charts.A closer look at the bank's revenue streams.


Before diving head-first into everything Bank of America, we
must first cover the concept of the bank's net interest income.
It's that important.Banks accept deposits from customers -- checking and savings
accounts, or certificates of deposit. Those accounts pay
deposit holders a small amount of interest for keeping that
cash at the bank. Deposits account for about 60% of the bank's
funding sources, making them critically important.The bank reinvests those deposits in the form of loans.
Loans are the largest asset group on the bank's books,
representing over 40% of total assets. To make money, the
bank charges a higher interest rate for loans than it pays on
deposits. The difference is known as a bank's net interest
income.For most banks, the net interest income is its single
largest revenue stream. Bank of America is no different. In the
2015 second quarter, B of A's net interest
income represented 48% of its revenue.Source: Bank of America 10-Q, June 30, 2015. Dollars shown in
millions.Generally speaking, the bigger the bank, the more revenue
streams it will have. Bank of America has a strong income
stream from its wealth management and brokerage business,
primarily driven by its Merrill Lynch subsidiary. In aggregate,
investment and brokerage income represented 15.2% of its Q2
revenue. The bank also generates meaningful revenue from
service charges, trading, investment banking, card, and
mortgage fees.From this 40,000-foot perspective, Bank of America's
business really is not all that complex.. It primarily accepts
deposits, invests in debt, and sells secondary
products that assist its customers with all of their
varied financial needs.And now, let's talk about expenses


In the same way, Bank of America's expenses are not very
complicated either.Source: Bank of America 10-Q, June 30, 2015. Dollars shown in
millions.The interest a bank pays to its depositors is always a huge
expense, particularly when interest rates are at higher
levels.  However, it is convention to account for that
expense as a component of the net interest income we
discussed above. That's why interest expense is not included in
the expense chart here.With interest expense out of the way, we can focus on the
bank's other large expenses. Personnel expense -- the bank's
largest -- constitutes 46% of operating expenses, nearly three
times more than the 14% representing income taxes. The rest of
the bank's operating expenses primarily revolve around
operating Bank of America's branch network across the
country.Data processing, equipment, occupancy, telecommunications,
and other operating expenses combine to account for billions of
dollars in expenses. Remember, these figures only represent
three months of business. These are massive dollar amounts, and
each is required to keep the doors open each workday.What does this exercise teach us about Bank of
America's business?


Now that we are fully acquainted with B of A's
revenue streams and expenses, we need to make sense of
what this all means to us as investors.First, deposits and loans clearly matter. The company's net
interest income is far and away the largest and most important
source of revenue.Second, the bank's branch network is clearly critical. The
branches help the bank collect those deposit accounts it needs
to produce a strong net interest margin. However, branches are
also very expensive to operate. Branch-related expenses --
occupancy expenses, personnel, equipment, etc -- dominate the
chart above  .Third, we can't ignore the gorilla in the banking industry
right now: interest rates. For Bank of America, rates are going
to play a major role over the next few years. We can see why in
how the income statement is constructed today.The short-term repercussions are difficult to predict, but
over a long time horizon, a higher-rate environment will be a
net positive for banks. Interest rates will rise for both
borrowers and depositors, but the price of loans will rise
farther than the interest paid on deposits, in large part
because of all the deposit accounts that don't offer any
interest payments at at all.  When the dust settles,
that means higher net interest income.Looking back at Bank of America's expenses again, there
are branch costs, employee costs, data costs, etc. -- none of
which will rise because of interest rates. That means that as
the bank's net interest margins expand, that increase should
translate directly to higher net income.That means higher returns on assets, higher returns on
equity, and with any luck, a higher stock price.The next billion-dollar iSecret

Bank of America

, it isn't unreasonable to conclude after Wednesday's
earnings release

that the nation's second-biggest bank by assets has finally
turned the corner.Revenue was up for the three months ended June 30. Expenses
were down. And Bank of America
earned more money before taxes

than it has since the financial crisis.Take it from someone who has followed Bank of America
closely for four years: It was an impressive performance.Bank of America adopts a new tone at the top



Two things in particular struck me as I listened to the bank's
conference call

with analysts. The first was the change in management's tone
and, specifically, the focus of CEO Brian Moynihan's
comments.On previous calls, Moynihan has saved most of his prepared
remarks for discussing expense control and cycling through the
standard list of industry benchmarks -- such as credit quality,
capital levels, and the growth of online and mobile
banking.There's no question that these are important. If there's
one thing Bank of America must do

to compete with
Wells Fargo

and
JPMorgan Chase

, it's get expenses under control. Last year, Bank of America
spent 89.2% of its net revenue to operate the business, leaving
only 10.8% to cover loan loss provisions, pay taxes, and
distribute to shareholders through dividends and share
buybacks. By contrast, 35% of JPMorgan's net revenue was left
over after operating expenses, and 41% of Wells Fargo's top
line emerged free and clear of costs.Given those circumstances, it was remarkable that Moynihan
dedicated only three sentences of his prepared remarks to
expenses:On the expense side, we told you that we achieved [Project
New BAC's] cost savings back in the third quarter of last
year. However we didn't give up on our focus on expenses, and
you can see those in the results. It's the lowest
non-litigation expense base since 2008.The reason Moynihan changed his script may be that Bank of
America seems to have finally reduced its bloated expense base
to a manageable level. Its
efficiency ratio

in the second quarter was 62.5%, well within reach of the
sub-60% level of the country's
most efficient banks

.Banks of America's 2011 expense initiative,
Project New BAC

, reduced annual expenses by $8 billion. The majority of
outstanding legal liabilities are now in the rearview mirror
(more on that in a moment). And the headcount at Bank of
America's unit tasked with disposing of toxic and noncore
assets
has fallen

from its peak of 41,800 full-time employees in the second
quarter of 2012 to 12,600 today.Thus, rather than talking about expenses, Moynihan pivoted
toward a discussion of increasing sales -- or, as he put it,
""invest[ing] in the future"" of Bank of America:Just to mention a few of these investments, we added sales
specialists in our financial centers, up 3% versus last year.
We added 3% to our financial advisors since last year, 4% to
our commercial and business bankers. We've opened new
financial centers in new markets that we previously didn't
have coverage and we continue to upgrade those in other
markets.In addition, we continue to invest in young new talent in
our company. We hired a record number of teammates from
college, over 1,200, and we have our intern program to over
1,800 this summer. And we continue to invest as we have said
in technology, so that was $3 billion we spent this year to
continue to improve and drive our products and our
capabilities in the company.Not to belabor the point, but this represents a dramatic
shift in Moynihan's tone over the course of his tumultuous
five-year tenure.Bank of America's legal troubles may finally be over



The second thing that caught my attention concerned Bank of
America's estimate of its outstanding legal liabilities. While
large corporations will always be in and out of court, none has
ever experienced the cumulative degree of legal damage that
Bank of America has since 2008.By
my count

, B of A has incurred upwards of $100 billion worth of legal
fines and settlements over the past seven years. The lion's
share of these charges relates to Countrywide Financial's sale
of faulty mortgage-backed securities to institutional investors
in the years before Bank of America acquired the
mortgage-originator-cum-criminal-enterprise on the eve of the
financial crisis

.Not unlike televisions sold by an electronics retailer,
financial products such as residential mortgages that are sold
to institutional investors come with representations and
warranties that guarantee the integrity of the underlying
product. If the product is faulty, then a buyer can, in
essence, return it to the seller by making a representation and
warranty claim just as you would with a faulty
refrigerator.This particular type of claim has cost Bank of America
dearly. To name just a few of its biggest rep-and-warranty
settlements:In August 2014, Bank of America agreed to a $16.65
billion settlement with government regulators.In March 2014, the bank entered into a $9.5 billion
settlement with the Federal Housing Finance Agency.In January 2013, it paid $11.2 billion in various forms
of relief to Fannie Mae.In June 2011, Bank of America reached an $8.5 billion
settlement with 22 private institutional investors.Although you'd be excused for thinking that claims like
these must be coming to an end -- after all, the housing bubble
burst nearly a decade ago -- the reality is that they've
continued to haunt Bank of America into the present year. From
April 2014 through March 2015, the bank received more than $10
billion in new rep-and-warranty claims. Over the same period,
Bank of America earned only $8.5 billion in net income.The good news for Bank of America's shareholders is that
this may have finally come to a halt. At the very least, the
magnitude of the rep-and-warranty claims is no longer
oppressive. A ruling by New York's highest court during the
quarter appears to bar all claims brought more than six years
after the date the representations and warranties were made. As
CFO Bruce Thompson explained:This quarter there was a closely watched case in New
York's highest court, which confirmed that New York's
six-year statute of limitation on filing rep-and-warrant
claims begins to run at the time the reps and warranties are
made and not at some later point in time. Based on our review
of the relevant documents we believe the vast majority of the
bank's remaining rep-and-warranty obligations are governed by
New York law.The net result is that Bank of America was able to reduce
the amount of money it sets aside to cover rep-and-warranty
claims by $7.6 billion. Furthermore, while the bank previously
estimated that it could face $4 billion in losses above its
rep-and-warranty provisions, the ruling led Bank of America to
cut this projection in half. It now expects the total range of
possible losses to be ""up to $2 billion"" over existing accruals
as of June 20.To say that this removes a dark cloud of uncertainty from
over Bank of America's head would be an understatement, as
concerns about ongoing legal losses have almost certainly
played into the fact that its shares, until this week anyway,
traded for a roughly
20% discount to their book value

.At the end of the day, in turn, while it may be premature
for Bank of America to claim complete victory over the
consequences of its past mistakes, there is a growing chorus of
evidence suggesting that it may have done just that.This $19 trillion industry could destroy the
Internet

of America and Procter & Gamble will run away from them.



optionMONSTER's Heat Seeker program detected unusual activity in
both large-cap stocks yesterday, raising speculation among traders
in our premium chat room that these are ""Hail Mary trades"" by money
managers who have missed out on the recent rallies: cheap long-shot
bets that will help them save face if the market continues to move
higher.



In BAC, activity focused on the February 12.50 calls, which saw
more than 31,500 contracts trade in volume well above the strike's
previous open interest of 4,056, indicating new activity. They
initially fetched $0.01 but then ratcheted up to $0.08 as the
buying persisted and the shares climbed.



The bulls turned to PG next, snapping up more than 16,000 March 80
calls for $0.08. This was clearly new positioning as well, as that
strike's open interest was just 1,139 contracts at the start of the
session.


Long calls

such as these lock in the price where investors can buy shares.
They can generate huge leverage if the stocks move in the right
direction but will expire worthless if shares decline or don't
climb far enough and fast enough. (See our

Education

section)



BAC jumped 3.25 percent to $12.24, at one point hitting a 21-month
high of $12.34. Its February 12.50 calls expire this Friday, so
those buyers are looking for a quick move to the upside.



PG rose 0.22 percent to $75.98. Its March 80 calls have 4-1/2 weeks
before they run out of time.

investors when there are more than 7,000 publicly traded
companies to choose from on U.S. stock exchanges. But investors
also understand that finding a company with a solid business
model can also propel their wealth to new heights over the long
run.A study conducted by J.P. Morgan Asset Management, using
data from Lipper, between Dec. 31, 1993, and Dec. 31, 2013,
found that holding onto the
S&P 500

over this entire 20-year period without selling would have
netted investors a 483% gain. Mind you, this period included
two major bear markets that witnessed the S&P 500 plunge by
more than 50%. Comparatively, the data also showed that missing
just 10 of the top-performing days in this approximately
5,000-day trading period would have reduced your return to a
mere 191%. Miss a little over 30 of the S&P 500's best
days, and your gain disappeared completely. In sum, thinking
long-term and finding great companies is the tried-and-true way
to build inflation-topping wealth.15 reasons to buy Bank of America and never
sell


What companies should you consider? While the gambit is
certainly not narrowed down to just one or two, one company
that could cross your radar is money center giant
Bank of America

. Having put the mortgage meltdown in the rearview mirror, here
are 15 reasons you might consider adding Bank of America to
your portfolio and never selling.1. Brand recognition



Perhaps the easiest thing to like about Bank of America is its
brand value and recognition. Sure, banks may not be the most
likable industry, but a report released in 2011 from Brand
Finance listed Bank of America as having the most valuable
banking brand in the world. Brand recognition can go a long way
to securing new clients and retaining existing customers.2. Interest rate normalization



No one knows for certain where interest rates are going to head
next, but history shows us that lending rates tend to
historically run quite a few percentage points higher than
where they are now. Higher lending rates can help boost net
interest margin for banks (the difference between the average
interest rate charged to customers they lend to and the
interest rate banks pay on the money they borrow), and it's
probably not unreasonable to think we'll head back to ""normal""
levels at some point in the future.Image source: Bank of America.3. GDP growth



Sometimes finding great stocks means playing the numbers game.
For decades it wasn't uncommon to see U.S. GDP grow at a mid-
to high-single-digit percentage. In today's economy, a 3%
growth rate seems reasonable. In spite of the inevitable
hiccups that occur during recessions, U.S. and global GDP is
slated to march higher over the long term, which could more
chances for banking giants like Bank of America to make an
impact.4. Well-capitalized



Bank of America has also come a long way since the Great
Recession in terms of its capitalization. It ended the first
quarter with $162.7 billion in Tier 1 common capital, which is
nearly $23 billion higher than the threshold considered to be a
well-capitalized bank. When another recession strikes, B of A
should be prepared.5. Loan and deposit growth



We're also seeing growth in the bread and butter of banking
profits. Forget derivatives and other riskier growth prospects;
Bank of America's most recent quarterly report showed deposit
growth of $64.1 billion to $1.2 trillion and total loan growth
of $28.4 billion to $901.1 billion. As long as both figures are
ticking higher, B of A's core business can be perceived as
healthy.6. Improved loan portfolio mix



Bank of America has also worked on attempting to diversify and
simplify its product offerings. As an example of this, the bank
is increasing its loan exposure to businesses as a percentage
of overall loans. By the end of 2009, about two-thirds of its
loan portfolio was tied up with consumers (mainly in housing
mortgages). By the end of Q1 2016, its loan portfolio was
perfectly mixed 50%-50% between commercial and consumer
clients.7. Cost-cutting



Cutting costs and simplifying its product and service offerings
is critical for B of A to maintain or grow its operating
margin. For example, as of Q1 2016 it had reduced the number of
home loan products from 136 to just 39, and checking accounts
from 22 types to just three. After completing a reorganization
in 2014 that cut $8 billion in expenses annually, B of A shaved
more than $19 billion off in costs between 2011 and 2015.Image source: Bank of America.8. Long-term debt decline



Long-term debt is a drag that can keep a business's valuation
from achieving its full potential. Thankfully, Bank of America
has reduced its long-term debt from $523 billion by the end of
2009 to $233 billion as of the end of Q1 2016. This could even
give B of A enough breathing room to consider growing
inorganically.9. Share repurchase program



One thing Bank of America and its board do believe in is
rewarding long-term shareholders. Last year, Bank of America's
board authorized a $4 billion share repurchase agreement. Just
last month it authorized adding another $800 million to that
total. Buying back shares can reduce the number of shares
outstanding, boosting EPS and making a company's stock look
more attractive in the process.10. Payout ratio



Bank of America's dividend yield may not be much to look at
right now (1.3% yield), but its payout ratio of just 15% (based
on Wall Street's 2016 full-year EPS consensus) suggests that
dividend expansion is likely in the future.11. Litigation a distant memory



Since the housing bubble burst, and through the midpoint of
2014, Bank of America forked over $61.2 billion in settlement
feels to the Justice Department according to
The Huffington Post

. This accounted for practically half of the $128 billion in
total settlement collected by the Justice Department between
2009 and mid-2014.  Today litigation expenses are nearly
gone, meaning investors are getting a much clearer view of B of
A's profit potential.12. Management tenure



Great companies don't always have great managers, but it's a
bonus in this case that Bank of America's leaders tend to stick
around for a while. Since 2001 we've only seen two CEOs at the
helm, with current CEO Brian Moynihan manning the reins since
Ken Lewis stepped down in 2010. Having continuity at the top
often means a business's long-term growth strategy stays on
track.Image source: Bank of America.13. Product and service innovation



Just because B of A has simplified its products and services
doesn't mean it's stopped innovating. It's catering to
millennials with fingerprint and touch ID sign-in capabilities
for select Android and iOS users of its banking app, and it's
been courting enterprise clients with the introduction of its
Bank of America Merrill Lynch Lockbox service in October for
the digitization and processing and paper payments. Innovations
like these (and many more) can help set B of A apart from its
peers.14. Institutional ownership



Although I'd never advocate blindly following money managers
into a stock, you should know that 63% of Bank of America's
shares are being held by institutional investors (more than
1,500 funds and institutions). This means quite a few
perceived-to-be smart money managers believe Bank of America
will be worth more in the future than it is now.15. Valuation


Finally, Bank of America looks to be priced very attractively.
On traditional fundamental metrics, it's trading at around nine
times forward earnings and with a reasonable Price/Earnings to
Growth ratio of around 1.5. More important, it's trading below
its tangible book value ($16.17) as of the end of the first
quarter. Most banks typically trade closer to 1.5-to-2 times
their tangible book value to be deemed ""fairly valued.""I'm already a four-year-plus owner of Bank of America stock
and I simply see no reason to sell. What point stands out most

Image credit: iStock/Thinkstock.The most important thing I took away from Brian Moynihan's
recently released
2015 shareholder letter

was his statement that
Bank of America

is ""no longer clouded over"" by crisis-related liabilities. The
significance of this sentiment is underscored by the fact that
it came in the first paragraph of the CEO's statement, which
noted that (emphasis added):In 2015, your company earned nearly $16 billion and
returned nearly $4.5 billion in capital.
This progress is the result of continued strong business
performance, no longer clouded over by heavy mortgage and
crisis-related litigation and operating costs

.This wasn't the first time in the past year that Moynihan
has made this type of claim. He
hinted at it in July

in his remarks announcing the bank's second-quarter earnings,
which shifted from a focus on expense and risk management to
that of revenue generation -- or, what he referred to as
""invest[ing] in the future."" As Moynihan said on the quarterly
call with analysts:Just to mention a few of these investments, we added sales
specialists in our financial centers, up 3% versus last year.
We added 3% to our financial advisors since last year, 4% to
our commercial and business bankers. We've opened new
financial centers in new markets that we previously didn't
have coverage and we continue to upgrade those in other
markets.In addition, we continue to invest in young new talent in
our company. We hired a record number of teammates from
college, over 1,200, and we have our intern program to over
1,800 this summer. And we continue to invest as we have said
in technology, so that was $3 billion we spent this year to
continue to improve and drive our products and our
capabilities in the company.The change in Moynihan's tone was supported by two
occurrences last year that garnered little attention. The first
was a decision by a New York state judge that reduced Bank of
America's outstanding crisis-related legal liabilities by
$7.6 billion

. The judgment also stemmed the inflow of new claims, dropping
them at the time from an average of approximately $2 billion a
quarter down to roughly $200 million.The second thing event to note also occurred in the second
quarter, when all three of the nation's leading credit-rating
agencies
increased their ratings on Bank of America

. A company of Bank of America's size and complexity has
numerous ratings that apply to its parent company,
subsidiaries, and various debt and equity instruments -- not
all of which were increased. But the fact that there was
positive movement in some of them is significant.I've discussed the significance of this in the past. If Bank
of America's debt ratings matched
Wells Fargo

's, it could save upwards of
$2 billion a year

in interest expense on long-term debt alone.In sum, while there's no doubt that Bank of America still
has considerable room to improve -- as is evidenced by its
0.74% return on average assets last year, roughly half what
Wells Fargo achieved -- positive and unequivocal statements
like Moynihan's above will certainly be welcome news for
investors in the nation's second-biggest bank by assets.A secret billion-dollar stock opportunity

's shares took a drubbing this week after Federal Reserve
Chairwoman Janet Yellen intimated that the central bank is
""taking a look"" at negative interest rates, and ""wouldn't take
those off the table.""Negative interest rates seem complicated, but they're easy
to understand. Every bank has to keep 10% or so of its
customers' deposits in reserve to pay funds out when depositors
ask for them. Banks deposit these reserves at the 12 Federal
Reserve branches -- thus the name Federal
Reserve

.Banks earn interest on their reserves just like you and I
earn interest on our deposits. The Fed currently pays an
interest rate of 0.50% on excess reserves. This adds up quickly
for the nation's biggest banks.
JPMorgan Chase

 has $337 billion on reserve at the central bank, which
will yield $1.7 billion in interest in 2016. Bank of America
has $123 billion, which should earn $613 million in interest
income this year.Data source: FDIC's Statistics on Depository Institutions.This is where negative interest rates come into play.
Negative rates mean that the Fed will start charging banks to
hold their reserves. Thus, rather than paying banks 0.50% in
interest on those funds, they'll instead charge them 0.25% (or
whatever) to hold them. This would incentivize the nation's
banks to put their $2.3 trillion in excess reserves -- that is,
above and beyond what they're legally obligated to have on
deposit at the Fed -- to work by lending the money out to
businesses and consumers.The logic behind negative interest rates is compelling. In
Bank of America's case, a swing in rates from a positive 0.50%
to a negative 0.25% would cost it $920 million in annual
pre-tax income. That's a lot for a bank that earned only $15.9
billion last year -- and, mind you, 2015 was its best year in
nearly a decade. To offset this, Bank of America would likely
take its excess reserves and invest them in government bonds,
or highly rated commercial paper, or by increasing its loan
book. While this would presumably spur economic output, the
downside to doing so is that it entails more risk. Even highly
rated corporations and the most creditworthy borrowers default
on their financial obligations from time to time.Negative interest rates would thus lodge Bank of America,
and all other banks, between a rock and a hard place. It
couldn't leave the money on reserve at the Fed without
impairing its short-term profitability. But by investing the
funds elsewhere, Bank of America would add credit risk to its
balance sheet, which could weigh on its long-term
profitability. It's this catch-22 that caused Bank of America's
shares to fall so precipitously on Thursday.The next billion-dollar iSecret

Marc Moz.Closing costs are all of the fees and expenses associated
with the closing or settlement of a real estate transaction,
and they can vary dramatically. In addition, the buyer
typically pays many closing costs, while others are usually the
responsibility of the seller. Here's what you need to know
about the closing costs you may have to pay when you buy your
next home, and how you may be able to avoid closing costs
altogether.Buyer's closing costs



Closing costs for homebuyers aren't cheap -- typically ranging
from 2% to 5% of the sale price. In other words, if you buy a
$200,000 house, you can expect closing costs of between $4,000
and $10,000.As a buyer, your closing costs may include, but are not
limited to:Attorney fees -- real estate closings usually involve an
attorney for the buyer, seller, or both.Credit report fees -- to qualify for a mortgage, your
lender will check your credit and may pass this expense on to
you.Loan origination fees -- this is a fee your lender
charges for processing your loan's paperwork.Inspection fees -- many lenders require home and/or pest
inspections before a mortgage can be approved.Discount points -- lenders charge this initial (and
optional) fee in exchange for a lower interest rate for the
life of the loan.Appraisal fees -- an appraisal is required to verify that
the sale price of the property is justified.Survey fees -- either party can pay these fees to confirm
the size and dimensions of the land.Lender's title insurance -- sellers pay the majority of
title insurance costs, but the policy that protects the
lender is typically the buyer's responsibility.Title search fees -- a background check on the title is
run to search for unpaid liens on the property.Escrow deposits -- your lender will probably require you
to pre-pay a few months of taxes and insurance to form a
""cushion"" in your loan's escrow account.Recording fees -- these are paid to your city or county
for recording your purchase.Underwriting fees -- these are the cost of evaluating
your loan application.It's important to note that these fees, as well as the
buyer's responsibility to pay them, can vary widely based on
your location. For example, if you live in a state with high
property taxes, your prepaid escrow deposit can be
significantly higher than average. If you want an estimate for
your situation,
Bank of America

provides a useful
calculator

that can help you estimate your closing costs based on
location, down payment, and loan type. Many other lenders will
offer similar tools.Seller's closing costs



Sellers generally have fewer items to pay than buyers, but that
doesn't mean they get off easy. In fact, sellers are
responsible for paying sales commissions to both parties' real
estate agents, which usually adds up to 6% of the sales price.
So this expense alone is usually more than all of the buyer's
closing costs.In addition to commissions, other closing costs sellers have
to pay may include:Title insurance premiums -- sellers usually pay for the
owner's title insurance, which protects the owner in the
event that title issues are discovered.Transfer taxes and recording fees -- these are taxes and
fees that county or local governments impose for the official
transfer of the property's title.Prorated taxes and HOA dues -- Sellers have to compensate
buyers for the fees they'll pay for the months before they
took ownership.Home warranty premiums -- it's quite common for sellers
to offer a home warranty, usually for one year, to give
buyers peace of mind and increase interest in their
property.How to avoid closing costs when buying a home



Closing costs can be rather expensive and can seem like a large
burden, particularly for first-time homebuyers who don't have a
lot of money for a down payment.However, it's a common practice to ask the seller to pay
some or all of the buyer's closing costs. This arrangement can
be worked into the purchase offer, either as a set dollar
amount or a percentage of the sale price. For example, if a
seller is asking $200,000 for the home, an offer might be
""$195,000, plus 3% of the purchase price toward buyer's closing
costs.""Sellers are usually inclined to agree to pay closing costs
with an otherwise attractive offer. If you plan to ask for
seller-paid closing costs, here's how to give yourself the best
chance of a ""yes.""Make a strong offer -- generally, when asking for closing
costs, a purchase offer is made for close to the full listing
price. In the example of an offer of $195,000 plus up to 3%
back at closing, this is
really

worth just over $189,000 to the seller, so be sure to keep
the true value of your offer in mind.Offer a quick close -- sellers are more likely to respond
favorably to a purchase offer if a quick close is part of it.
Seller-paid closing costs with a 30-day close may look a lot
more attractive than another offer asking for a 60-day
close.Make fewer demands -- in a nutshell, the easier your
offer seems, the more likely a seller will be willing to give
you what you want. A buyer who wants seller-paid closing
costs
and

a new deck, a repaved driveway, a patched-up roof, and 10
other repairs may seem like more trouble than it's
worth.The Foolish bottom line



While closing costs can be expensive, they shouldn't be the
limiting factor that keeps you from buying a home. In fact,
it's quite common for sellers to pay both sides of closing
costs to obtain a quick and easy sale, so it may be a good idea
to put this request in your offer if you're low on cash. After
all, the worst anyone can say is ""no.""The $15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees
completely overlook


If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more)
behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of
little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a
boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch
reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the
government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion
annually. For example: one easy, 17-minute trick could pay
you as much as $15,978 more... each year! Once you learn how
to take advantage of all these loopholes, we think you could
retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

TipsBank of America Corp

(NYSE:

BAC


) - BAC stock looks like an attractive buy as it approaches a
support line following news late last month that the financial
institution finally passed the Federal Reserve's stress test -
with flying colors. Its capital plan had been rejected by the
central bank in the two previous stress tests.Bank of America received regulatory approval to return more
capital to its shareholders. The firm announced plans for a $5
billion stock-buyback program and a 50% dividend hike. The
current payout is 5 cents per share for a forward annual yield of
1.5%, but starting in the third quarter, it will increase to 7.5
cents a share.Following the positive stress test results, S&P Capital IQ
Equity Research reiterated its ""Buy"" rating on BAC stock. Its
analysts have a 12-month price target of $17 on shares, which is
more than 26% above the current price.Turning to the chart, we see that BAC stock is still in a
downtrend defined roughly by resistance at its 200-day moving
average. However, after falling from over $18 in early November,
it appears shares are forming a possible triple-bottom at about
$13. The bottom is enforced by a buy signal from the MACD
indicator last week and a pickup in accumulation.Traders should look to buy BAC stock at $13 with a target of
$15.15, just above its 200-day moving average. If successful,
this will result in a profit of nearly 17%.Investors can buy BAC stock at the market price for a run to
Capital IQ's fundamental target of $17. Even when that target is
met, investors may still want to hold shares for a potential
turnaround in the banking sector due to rising interest rates. If
the Federal Reserve hikes rates late this year, it would have a
positive impact on big financial institutions.Click to EnlargeThe post

In fact, even if rates stay where they are today, following the increases at the end of 2016, the North Carolina-based bank should benefit immensely this year.It isn't hard to quantify how much Bank of America stands to gain, as it's laid out clearly in the bank's regulatory filings. As of the end of September, Bank of America estimated that a 100-basis-point increase in short- and long-term rates would translate into an additional $5.3 billion worth of net interest income in the following 12 months. This is high-margin revenue that, absent corporate income taxes, should largely fall to the bank's bottom line.Since then, both short- and long-term rates have in fact gone up. Long-term rates surged by as much as 100 basis points between the end of September and the middle of December, though they've since settled at about 80 basis points higher. And short-term rates climbed 25 basis pointsfollowing the Federal Reserve's monetary policy meeting in December.Given that rates didn't adhere precisely to Bank of America's interest rate sensitivity analysis, as neither short- nor long-term rates are currently 100 basis points higher, it won't benefit from the entire $5.3 billion boost to its top line. As things stand today, it will instead see about half that, or $2.4 billion. On a quarterly basis, that equates to $600 millionworth of additional net interest income that shareholders can expect it to earn between now and the end of this year.But even though this seems clear, there is one outstanding question: When Bank of America saysit will earn an extra $600 million in quarterly net interest income, what's that in addition to? Is it on top of its net interest income from the third quarter of last year, which was $10.2 billion? Is it on top of its fourth-quarter figure, which was $10.3 billion? Or is it in addition to some other number?The answer is that it's on top of Bank of America's fourth-quarter net interest income. Here's how this plays out:QuarterStarting Point: Q4 2016 Net Interest IncomeAdditional Net Interest Income From Q4 2016 Rate IncreasesAdjusted Net Interest IncomeQ1$10.3$0.6$10.9Q2$10.3$0.6$10.9Q3$10.3$0.6$10.9Q4$10.3$0.6$10.9Total$41.2$2.4$43.6Data source: Bank of America.Two points are worth mentioning here. The first is that interest rates will have to stay at or above where they were at the end of last year in order for these forecasts to come to fruition. If rates fall, which seems unlikely but you never know, then Bank of America wouldn't realize the full benefit.The second point is that, assuming rates don't fall, these estimates should be viewed as a floor, not a ceiling. That is to say that Bank of America's actual quarterly net interest income could very well end up higher, as the bank continues to grow its loan portfolio. The Fed could also raise rates further, as it expects to do.But even in the absence of growth, the trend in interest rates is auspicious for Bank of America. It earned $4.3 billionin the fourth quarter of last year. Tack on another $400 or so million in after-taxnet income, holding all else equal, and the bank's bottom line should be up 10% or so throughout the four quarters of 2017.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Bank of America

has made progress in atoning for its misdeeds from the financial
crisis. But it nevertheless continues to be haunted by an
unconscionably bloated

expense base.You can see this in its latest quarterly results, which were
released last week. For the three months ended Sept. 30, the
nation's second-largest bank by assets generated $21.2 billion in
revenue. Of this, $636 million was set aside in anticipation of
future loan losses, $663 million was reserved to pay income
taxes, and nearly all of the rest, $19.7 billion to be precise,
was consumed by noninterest expenses.The net result is that Bank of America extracted a mere $168
million in net income from more than $21 billion in revenue. To
make matters worse, all of this (and more) was then consumed by
the $238 million the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank paid in interest
to holders of its preferred stock, leaving common stock
shareholders in the hole for $70 million.Bank of America's principal problem is simple: It spends too
much of its revenue on operating expenses -- namely, litigation
costs, a sprawling branch network, and more than 200,000
employees.The good news is the bank has made significant inroads on all
three fronts. In August, Bank of America announced an historic
$16.65 billion settlement with the Department of Justice and
multiple state attorneys general that extinguishes all but one
major mortgage-related case dating back to the financial crisis (
click here

for a full list of the bank's legal settlements since 2008).Over the last four years, moreover, it has dramatically
curtailed its retail footprint. In the third quarter of 2010,
Bank of America operated 5,900 physical branches. At the end of
the latest quarter, that number had shrunk to 4,947.Finally, even though the bank today employs 230,000 employees
on a full-time equivalent basis, this figure is declining every
quarter thanks in large part to a winding down of Bank of
America's legacy assets and servicing division, which is
responsible for liquidating the bank's toxic and noncore assets.
At the height of LAS' operations, it employed nearly 42,000
employees. That number is now down to just 17,000.Bank of America remains a work in progress. In 2013, its
efficiency ratio was 77% -- this is the percent of net revenue
consumed by operating expenses. In the most recent quarter that
number was even worse. The bank's own goal is to see this ratio
drop down into the high 50% range.It remains to be seen whether this will happen. But either
way, for shareholders interested in gauging Bank of America's
progress, the first and last place to look should be its ability
to reduce expenses and thereby pass more of its income to
shareholders.Bank of America + Apple? This device makes it possible.

BAC

) reported first quarter results early Wednesday that missed
analyst estimates and shares slid in the pre-market.For the first quarter of 2013, Bank of America reported
earnings per share of $0.20 on adjusted revenue of $23.8 billion.
Analysts were expecting Bank of America to report earnings per
share of $0.23 on revenue of $23.5 billion. Revenue was driven
mostly by lower than expected provisions for losses on loans.In the quarter, the bank reported annual deposit growth of
five percent to $1.1 trillion. Also, Bank of America reported
that mortgage production rose 57 percent from the same period a
year ago to $24 billion and consumer credit losses fell to a
five-year low.Looking at the commercial business, commercial loans grew 17
percent from the same period a year ago to $367 billion. Bank of
America retained its number two global ranking in investment
banking fees in the quarter and the company's project New BAC
cost cutting initiative led to non-interest expense falling $1.0
billion.Net interest margin was 2.43 percent in the first quarter of
2013, compared to 2.35 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 and
2.51 percent in the first quarter of 2012. Net interest income,
on an adjusted basis, totaled $10.9 billion in the first quarter
of 2013, compared to $10.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012
and $11.1 billion in the first quarter of 2012.The improvement from the fourth quarter of 2012 was driven by
the favorable market-related impact of lower premium amortization
expense of $340 million, higher commercial loan balances, lower
average long-term debt, and lower rates paid on deposits,
partially offset by lower consumer loan balances and yields, and
the impact of two fewer days in the quarter.The company's Basel I Tier 1 capital ratio rose to 10.58
percent in the quarter, up from a pro-forma 10.38 percent in the
same period a year ago. Also, on a Basel III comparison, the
company's Tier 1 capital ratio rose to 9.42 percent from 9.25
percent in the same period a year ago.""Our strategy of connecting our customers to all we can do for
them is working,"" said Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan.
""Solid increases in loan growth to small businesses and
middle-market companies, four straight quarters of steady growth
in mortgage originations, record earnings in wealth management,
and another quarter near the top in investment banking fees show
we are balanced, focused and moving forward.""""There were many examples of progress this quarter,"" said
Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson. ""We reduced noninterest
expense by nearly $1 billion year-over-year, and credit costs
continued to decline. Our relentless focus on capital, liquidity,
and expense reduction enables us to be in position to return
excess capital to investors through the previously announced
common stock repurchase program and preferred stock
redemptions.""Bank of America shares fell 0.65 percent pre-market to $12.20.

Bank of America

's balance sheet was home to over $2.1 trillion in assets. That
figure would rank as the world's eighth largest economy by
GDP, just behind Brazil and slightly ahead of Italy.But don't let the bank's massive size intimidate you. Any
investor can understand its balance sheet, including you.Up first: equity, liabilities, and leverage.



The first step to analyzing Bank of America's balance sheet is
to take a look at it from a high level. We'll dive into a few
key details next.Bank of America has an assets-to-shareholder-equity
ratio of 8.5, a reasonable level and in line with other banks
in the U.S. That leverage ratio may be common in the banking
world, but it's still high. For context, if you were to buy a
house with that capital structure, your down payment would be
just 11.7%.The risk of all that leverage is mitigated by a few factors.
First, banks rely on cheap, stable customer deposits as the
backbone of their capital structure. That means that banks in
general don't need to worry about funding sources drying up
like companies in many other industries do.54% of Bank of America's balance sheet is funded by
customer deposits. Another 11% comes from predictable long-term
debt arrangements, and 10% more from Federal Funds.Source: Bank of America 10-Q, June 30, 2015.Second, the bank is considered well-capitalized using the
common equity tier 1 capital ratio. This ratio is a complex
calculation that takes into account not only the bank's ratio
of liabilities and equity, but also considers the riskiness of
the bank's assets and the level of reserves the bank has put
aside for worst case scenarios.Bank of America had a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.2% in
the second quarter. Regulators consider a 6% ratio to be the
minimum level required to be considered ""well-capitalized."" For
large, systemically important banks like B of A, additional
capital requirements are being phased in as part of the
regulatory overhaul following the financial crisis. By 2019, B
of A must have a minimum tier one common equity ratio of 8.5%,
a level the bank has already surpassed by 2.7 percentage
points.And speaking of reserves, the bank also maintains a
rainy-day fund, of sorts, called the allowance for loan and
lease losses, or ALLL. These reserves are earmarked to absorb
any losses the bank may incur from loans potentially going
bad.As of June 30, Bank of America reported its ALLL was $13.7
billion, or 1.5% of total loans and leases. This number is
calculated based on historical losses, current trends in the
bank's credit quality, and management judgement based on
economic trends. Most banks today report an ALLL between 1% and
2% of total loans and leases.Let's talk assets


On the other side of the balance sheet sits all of the stuff
that Bank of America owns -- its assets: cash, securities,
loans, and more.In percentage terms, the bank's loans and leases make up a
plurality of total assets at 41%. B of A is a bank, after all,
and banks are primarily in the business of making loans.The concentration in loans is consistent with the structure
of the bank's income statement, as you'd expect, and 48% of
Bank of America's revenue comes from net interest income from
loans.Additionally, Bank of America also holds $392 billion in
debt securities. While not technically loans, these securities
are largely backed by loans and function in a similar way
providing interest income to the bank. Together, loans and debt
securities represent 59% of the bank's assets.Source: Bank of America 10-Q, June 30, 2015.Another income driver on the balance sheet are the bank's
trading account assets, which totaled just shy of 9% of assets
at quarter-end; 7.4% of the bank's revenues came from these
trading accounts.The bank also maintains high levels of liquid and
almost-liquid assets. B of A reported $164 billion in cash or
cash equivalents, plus an additional $200 billion in sold
Federal funds and securities. Sold Federal funds and securities
are short-term loans, typically with a maturity of just a
single day, that are used to bring in a little extra income
from the bank's excess reserves held at the Federal
Reserve.A simpler balance sheet than you probably
thought


Understanding the bank's assets, liabilities, and equity in
this way provides investors with the baseline knowledge needed
to assess how the bank does business. You don't need an
advanced degree in accounting or a career's worth of experience
in finance to get up to speed.There are loans and deposits. There's a fair bit of
leverage. There's some cash put aside just in case the bank
needs it. There's really nothing all that extraordinary about
it, except for the $2.1 trillion sum if you add it all up.The next billion-dollar iSecret

Reuters reported last year that Sok was planning a 2018 flotation. Sok is one of four Turkish firms expected to list by May, sources said earlier this year.Companies have been taking advantage of equity prices that remain near record highs in Istanbul, as well as robust international demand for Turkish listings.

The rival to Ringcentraland 8x8hopes to reap 50 million euros in proceeds from the listing for European expansion.Springer Nature was formed in 2015 through the merger of Holtzbrinck's Macmillan Science and Education unit with BC Partners' Springer business, which publishes scientific, technical and medical books and journals.The tie-up was designed to make it easier to compete with the likes of RELXas publishers increasingly shift to digital content and readers use smartphones and tablets to access information.Sources close to the matter had told Reuters in late February, that Springer Nature has brought forward the listing which may value it at more than 7 billion euros including debt, to reduce the risk from volatile stock markets.Springer Nature, which says it is the largest English language academic book publisher with 13,000 new books every year, posted revenues of 1.64 billion euros in 2017, up 2.5 percent from 2016.Its adjusted operating income was 374 million in 2017, while adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization stood at 551 million euros.Peer RELX trades at about 14.4 times its expected core earnings. If Springer fetches a similar multiple it could be valued at up to 8 billion euros.The bulk of the proceeds from the listing are to be used to cut net debt by a third. That currently stands at roughly 3 billion euros, and Springer Nature is targeting a leverage of 3.5 times EBITDA after the IPO.Investors can expect a dividend payment of 110 million euros for the ending December 2018, and in following years Springer Nature expects to pay out about 50 percent of its annual adjusted net profit, the company said.JP Morganand Morgan Stanleyare organising the listing as so called global coordinators with the help of bookrunners Bank of America, BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachsand Societe Generale.Springer Nature is a separate company from German publisher Axel Springer.($1 = 0.8089 euros)","WorldMarkets,Economy,USMarkets,Stocks,IPOs","BAC","[{'news_title': 'European Stocks Modestly Higher Ahead of UK Jobs, Wage Data', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/european-stocks-modestly-higher-ahead-of-uk-jobs-wage-data-cm948770', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad5bd7d3efc2c36c6377f75'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 4/17/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-peter-lynch-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-4172018-cm948769', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad5bd7d3efc2c36c6377f76'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Motley Fool Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 4/17/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-motley-fool-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-4172018-cm948768', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad5bd7d3efc2c36c6377f77'}}]","{'$date': '2018-04-12T04:10:00Z'}"

In consumer banking, its biggest business, revenue increased 9 percent as higher interest rates helped BofA charge more for loans while keeping deposit rates low.Shares of the second-largest U.S. bank by assets rose 1 percent in premarket trading. They have gained 33 percent in the past 12 months, but fell about 3 percent along with other U.S. banks on Friday.""Strong client activity, coupled with a growing global economy and solid U.S. consumer activity, led to record quarterly earnings,"" Moynihan said in a statement.BofA's net interest income rose 5 percent in the first quarter, pushing total revenue up 4 percent to $23.28 billion. The lender relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximize profits as it has a large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities.Total loans and leases rose 3 percent, while total deposits increased 4.4 percent.The only business to record a fall in revenue was global banking, hurt by lower investment banking fees.Non-interest expenses declined 1 percent, while income tax expenses fell about 26 percent.The bank's efficiency ratio, a closely watched measure of revenue divided by expenses, was 60 percent in the first quarter, down from 63 percent a year earlier. A low ratio indicates a bank is more efficient.Jefferies analysts said BofA results looked best among peers that have reported so far.The bank, however, underperformed in fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading because of a decline in bond issuance from corporations, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a call with journalists. Less bond issuance can, in turn, affect credit trading in secondary markets.Trading revenue was up only 1 percent. Equities trading revenue, excluding items, rose 38 percent, while revenue from trading fixed income fell 13 percent.BofA's trading results mirrored those of rivals JPMorgan Chase & Coand Citigroup Inc. Revenue from stock trading rose at both the banks, but weakness in bond trading crimped total trading revenue growth.Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $6.49 billion from $4.84 billion a year earlier. Earnings per share rose to 62 cents, beating the average analyst estimate of 59 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S (graphic).","FundamentalAnalysis,Stocks,WorldMarkets,BankingandLoans,Earnings","BAC","[{'news_title': 'European Stocks Modestly Higher Ahead of UK Jobs, Wage Data', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/european-stocks-modestly-higher-ahead-of-uk-jobs-wage-data-cm948770', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad5c6c13efc2c36c637b809'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 4/17/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-peter-lynch-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-4172018-cm948769', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad5c6c13efc2c36c637b80a'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Motley Fool Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 4/17/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-motley-fool-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-4172018-cm948768', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad5c6c13efc2c36c637b80b'}}]","{'$date': '2018-04-16T07:06:00Z'}"

In consumer banking, its biggest business, revenue increased 9 percent as higher interest rates helped BofA charge more for loans while keeping deposit rates low.Shares of the second-largest U.S. bank by assets rose 1 percent in premarket trading. They have gained 33 percent in the past 12 months, but fell about 3 percent along with other U.S. banks on Friday.""Strong client activity, coupled with a growing global economy and solid U.S. consumer activity, led to record quarterly earnings,"" Moynihan said in a statement.BofA's net interest income rose 5 percent in the first quarter, pushing total revenue up 4 percent to $23.28 billion. The lender relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximize profits as it has a large stock of deposits and rate-sensitive mortgage securities.Total loans and leases rose 3 percent, while total deposits increased 4.4 percent.The only business to record a fall in revenue was global banking, hurt by lower investment banking fees.Non-interest expenses declined 1 percent, while income tax expenses fell about 26 percent.The bank's efficiency ratio, a closely watched measure of revenue divided by expenses, was 60 percent in the first quarter, down from 63 percent a year earlier. A low ratio indicates a bank is more efficient.Jefferies analysts said BofA results looked best among peers that have reported so far.The bank, however, underperformed in fixed income, currency and commodities (FICC) trading because of a decline in bond issuance from corporations, Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said on a call with journalists. Less bond issuance can, in turn, affect credit trading in secondary markets.Trading revenue was up only 1 percent. Equities trading revenue, excluding items, rose 38 percent, while revenue from trading fixed income fell 13 percent.BofA's trading results mirrored those of rivals JPMorgan Chase & Coand Citigroup Inc. Revenue from stock trading rose at both the banks, but weakness in bond trading crimped total trading revenue growth.Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $6.49 billion from $4.84 billion a year earlier.

The tests are meant to ensure banks have enough capital in sharp downturns to meet regulatory requirements.Meanwhile, the new tax law could deliver a one-two punch to capital measured in the stress tests.After first writing down deferred tax assets to account for a lower corporate rate, banks now face being prevented from carrying back losses in stress testing to past profitable quarters to benefit from tax rebates.Analysts are likely to push executives for details on the complex tax issues and already opaque stress tests. Lenders submitted their balance sheets for testing last week.First-quarter net income for JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Citigroup likely rose 34 percent, 5 percent and 12 percent, respectively, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.They see banks boosted by higher interest rates, stronger lending and underwriting and the 14 percentage point cut in the federal corporate tax rate.'MATERIAL EFFECTS'Banks will likely see bigger reductions in projected capital levels in this year's exam, a banking industry economist said.Chubak and the economist said they cannot estimate the extent of the capital hit without more information from the banks.In a March 2, the Fed cited elimination of carrybacks as one reason the tax law could have ""material"" negative effects on some banks in this year's stress test (graphic).Goldman Sachs said in January that a key measure of capital shrank by 0.7 percentage points to 10.7 percent at Dec. 31 because of one-time tax charges, which included marking down deferred tax assets, such as credits against future taxes known as loss carryforwards.In stress tests before the tax law change, carrybacks from losses could support capital levels and improve the odds of bigger approved buybacks. Now, more potential losses would eat into capital.Capital One Financial Corpin December cited the elimination of carrybacks for reduction in its buyback plans.To be sure, executives could flag offsets to those effects. Goldman, like other banks with profits kept overseas, picked up deferred tax liabilities for so-called repatriation taxes it booked in the fourth quarter but had not yet paid.Still, under changes to factors in the Fed's ""severely adverse"" economic and financial scenarios, banks could be tested against the most extreme change in conditions since the reviews began in 2009.In this year's test the most extreme hypothetical unemployment rate surges almost 6 percentage points to 10 percent.The March letter also said changes to several scoring models are likely to reduce capital, with ""material effects"" in some cases.For example, the Fed will calculate the probability of default on U.S. credit cards differently. JPMorgan and Citigroup are two big card issuers but have not discussed their outlook for payouts in light of the letter.Letter on enhancements to Federal Reserve models (graphic).","Stocks,WorldMarkets,BankingandLoans,Politics","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Why This Huge Marijuana Stock Is Soaring 10% Today', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-this-huge-marijuana-stock-is-soaring-10-today-cm949148', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad63b383efc2c38e3fe76bb'}}, {'news_title': 'Citigroup (C) Q1 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/citigroup-c-q1-2018-earnings-conference-call-transcript-cm949153', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad63b383efc2c38e3fe76bc'}}, {'news_title': 'Breaking Down Big Bank Earnings', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/breaking-down-big-bank-earnings-cm949158', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad63b383efc2c38e3fe76bd'}}]","{'$date': '2018-04-10T01:00:00Z'}"

of weeks of trading in January to set the tone for the
remainder of the year. This past week for the
Dow Jones Industrial Average

,
Nasdaq Composite

, and
S&P 500

was nothing short of ugly. The S&P 500, Dow Jones, and
Nasdaq lost 6%, 6.2%, and 7.3% for the week, respectively. This
is the worst five-day start to a new year for the stock market
ever

.Trading in January historically tends to be positive more
often than not simply because the end-of-year selling (i.e.,
tax-loss selling) that occurred for tax purposes in December is
now over. You may have heard this referred to as the ""January
Effect."" January is also the month where we begin to get a look
at fourth-quarter (and thus holiday-based) earnings reports,
which tend to be the beefiest for the service and
consumer-oriented sectors. All told, 39 of the past 66
January's for the S&P 500 have ended higher. The start to
this January, though, has left a lot to be desired.Three questions every investor should be asking
themselves


Whether it's uncertainties with China's economy, North Korea's
purported hydrogen bomb test, or weakening commodity prices led
by oil, some traders are ready to run for the hills. But,
instead of crawling under the sheets to hide from the sea of
red arrows, consider asking yourself the following three
questions.Image source: Pixabay.1. Do I need this money in the next one to three years?



The ultimate goal for investors is to try and find businesses
that have a solid long-term outlook and could handily
outperform their peers and the broader market. This does mean
investors will deal with inevitable pullbacks in the stock
market and recessions in the U.S. economy, but it also means
plenty of opportunity to watch the businesses you own grow over
time during extended periods of bullishness.With the stock market plunging, what investors need to ask
themselves is whether they need the money they're investing in
the next one-to-three years. If the answer is yes, then what
you're really doing is either trying to time the market or
speculating, which can both be somewhat dangerous. If that's
the case, you might be best off taking your investments off the
table now.However, if the money you've invested is designed to fund
your retirement, and your retirement or need for this money is
three or more years away, then there's really no immediate need
to be alarmed. Substantial gains are derived by allowing time
and compounding to do their work, and if you have time on your
side, then this past week will be nothing more than a blip in
your long-term investment history.Image source: Flickr user Jim Makos.2. Does my investment thesis still hold water for the
stocks in my portfolio?



If you don't have an immediate need for your invested money,
then it's time to move on to the second important question that
you'll want to ask yourself: Do you still believe in the
businesses that you own?The easiest way to establish whether you still believe in
the long-term thesis of a company is to examine why you bought
it in the first place. For instance, I purchased shares of
Bank of America

more than four years ago, and on numerous occasions I could
have decided to part ways with my shares after they had
doubled, and even tripled from my initial buy price. But I
remain steadfast in my decision to hang on to my Bank of
America shares. Why? Because the reasons I bought Bank of
America stock haven't changed since November 2011.Bank of America is still trading at a book value discount to
its peers; it stands to benefit in a big way once its legal
issues are safely put in the rearview mirror; and it should
benefit from widening net interest margins as lending rates
rise. These catalysts take time to be fully reflected in the
company's share price, and a volatile stock market doesn't
affect Bank of America's long-term game plan. In other words,
my investment thesis in Bank of America is still intact, so its
nearly 10% tumble last week really isn't anything for me to
worry about.What happens if you find a stock that no longer meets your
original investment thesis? In this instance it could be time
to consider selling. You certainly don't have to wait for a
stock market correction to sell one or more of your holdings
that no longer fits your investing thesis, but corrections such
as the one we observed this past week do often serve as a good
reminder that we should occasionally revisit our holdings and
gauge whether our investment thesis still holds water.Image source: Pixabay.3. Do I have money I can put to work right now?



The last question you should be asking yourself right now is
whether you have money that can reasonably be put to work in
the stock market. If you have no immediate need for your
invested money, and the reasons you bought what you're
currently holding in your investment portfolio still holds
water, then it could be time to consider adding to those
positions, or perhaps opening up new positions in businesses
that meet your investment criteria.Some of you might be scratching your heads and thinking,
""But what if the market goes lower?"" There's a simple answer to
that question: You buy more.Although there is no such thing as a given in the stock
market, and it's inevitable that we'll all lose money on a
stock trade at some point in our lives, the data is
overwhelmingly in favor of buy-and-hold investors over the
long-term. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has undergone 33
correction of 10% or more, not counting the most recent
correction from a few months prior. In
all 33 prior instances

the S&P 500 eventually retraced the entirety of the
correction lower and wound up hitting a new high. Sometimes it
did so in a matter of weeks, and in some instances it took
years to do so. However, one thing is clear: Corrections, while
common, tend to be erased completely over time, and that's
great news for the buy-and-hold investors.Another interesting point comes from J.P. Morgan Asset
Management. Using S&P 500 data from Lipper between Dec. 31,
1993 and Dec. 31, 2013, J.P. Morgan Asset Management showed
that buy-and-hold investors who never sold earned better than a
480% return during this period. However, investors who had
missed the 10 best trading days of the S&P 500 over this
20-year period (roughly 5,000 trading days) would have seen
their return fall from more than 480% to just 191%. Miss the 30
best days out of around 5,000 and your return was less than
20%, or below 1% annualized over a 20-year period.The lesson: If you have no immediate need for your invested
money, you like what you own, and you have money to put to work
right now, then there's probably not much you should be worried
about right now regardless of how poorly the market began
2016.The $15,978 Social Security bonus most retirees
completely overlook


If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more)
behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of
little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a
boost in your retirement income. In fact, one MarketWatch
reporter argues that if more Americans knew about this, the
government would have to shell out an extra $10 billion
annually. For example: one easy, 17-minute trick could pay
you as much as $15,978 more... each year! Once you learn how
to take advantage of all these loopholes, we think you could
retire confidently with the peace of mind we're all after.

Fortunately, in the case of Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) , the nation's second biggest bank by assets has designed its compensation structure to create incentive for long-term responsible growth.Bank of America Chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. Image source: Bank of America.This is especially true when it comes to Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan. In 2016, the 57-year-old executive earned a $20 million compensation package, which equated to a 25% raise over 2015. Reading between the lines of Bank of America's press release announcing the pay package, the bank boosted Moynihan's compensation for five reasons:Earnings in 2016 were up 13% compared with 2015 and were the second highest in the bank's history.The bank achieved positive operating leverage in 2016, meaning that its revenue grew faster than expenses.The bank achieved ""historically low credit losses"" last year.Total shareholder return through 2016 was 33%, which exceeded Bank of America's peer group.Finally, the North Carolina-based bank ""made progress on its long-term return on assets, return on tangible common equity, and efficiency goals.""But just because Moynihan's total compensation package added up to $20 million doesn't necessarily mean he'll get all of it. That's because a healthy portion of it came in the form of performance-based restricted stock units, which require the bank to meet certain objectives over the next three years for the entire award to vest.Compensation TypeAmountBase salary$1.5 millionPerformance-based RSUs$9.25 millionTime-based RSUs$9.25 millionTotal$20 millionRSUs-restricted stock units. Data source: Bank of America regulatory filing.For Moynihan's performance-based restricted stock units to vest, two things must happen: Bank of America must generate a three-year average return on assets of 0.80% and a three-year average growth of adjusted tangible book value of 8.5%. ""This pay-for-performance structure, which emphasizes variable pay, helps motivate our executives to deliver sustained stockholder value and responsible growth,"" the bank said in its latest proxy statement.The most important thing to note is the fact that a majority of Moynihan's performance comes in the form of stock -- i.e., not cash. His salary is obviously paid in cash, and $5.55 million of his time-based restricted stock units, which vest in equal monthly installments over the course of a year, are cash-settled, too. But that leaves nearly $13 million, or two-thirds of the potential total, coming in the form of stock, assuming the bank meets its performance targets. This is a good thing, because it ensures that Moynihan has a considerable and growing amount of skin in the game, so to speak, and is thereby closely aligned with the bank's shareholders.In short, while there's no getting around the fact that Moynihan earned a pretty penny last year, second only among commercial-bank CEOs to JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon, the good news is that his compensation plan seems to be designed with shareholders' interest in mind.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

popularity. People generally think that more indexing will make the
markets function less efficiently. I don't think this is true at
all. Unfortunately, the question and its answers are usually
shrouded in misunderstandings about how assets are priced and myths
about what it means to invest ""passively"". So, let's think about
this from an operational perspective.An index fund is not really an ""index"". They are portfolios
managed every day trying to track an index. These funds are managed
actively, and involve hundreds, if not thousands, of decisions
every year. The simplest example is the modern-day ETF, which is
essentially a real-time version of what most people think of as an
index fund. When you buy shares in an ETF, there is someone who is
actively managing the allocation of funds (the same is true for an
index mutual fund, though it's less apparent in real-time, since
the fund is not traded on an exchange). For instance, if the market
price of an ETF were to deviate from the intraday indicative value,
then the market makers would either buy/sell the ETF or buy/sell
the underlying securities. So, while there doesn't appear to be
much activity on the surface, the very act of buying an index fund
could actually force some active management in the underlying
securities markets. In other words, your ""passive"" investment is
the other side of the active management of the market maker or fund
administrator.¹It's not a coincidence that high-frequency trading firms and big
banks are making huge gobs of money during the rise of passive
indexing. After all, passive indexing means that there is a greater
need for those alternative forms of what is nothing more than
""active"" management. Unfortunately, the studies blasting active
management usually include mutual fund managers and not the most
active managers of them all - market makers and HFT firms. And make
no mistake - these ""active"" operations are hugely profitable
because they are essentially making ""passive"" portfolios
available.²The kicker here is that index funds really aren't passive at
all. When you look at the underlying components of how the funds
are actually managed, you realize that there's a lot of activity in
all of this. The fact that most index funds and ETFs are more tax-
and fee-efficient than mutual funds does not mean they are
necessarily less ""active"", though. People misuse the term ""passive
indexing"" on a near-daily basis now. And it's the result of this
desire to create a black-and-white view of the world, which is
usually nothing more than a marketing pitch (something along the
lines of - ""We're passive, so invest with us, because the
misleading academic studies show that 'active' managers are
dopes.""). The reality, however, is that there is really only active
management and its varying degrees. Literally no one replicates a
pre-fee and pre-tax index. Not a single investor. And your purchase
and maintenance of a ""passive"" strategy will require a good deal of
active upkeep.The bottom line is, most passive investing means there will be
greater demand for active managers in the form of market makers and
arbitrageurs. The ease of passive investing is made possible thanks
to these active underlying elements. And that's great, because it's
a win-win. Indexers get a low-fee and easy way to access markets.
But they also bear the cost of their laziness (in numerous unseen
ways), which is why making markets in index funds is hugely
profitable. So, if everyone indexed, then that much more active
market making would be required. End of story.¹ - Read

No decision is final, reports said.Sewing completed a bank apprenticeship at Deutsche Bank as a teenager in 1989 and moved up the ranks to senior positions responsible for audit, legal and risk. He has served on the management boardâ€""the lender's top executive ranksâ€""since January 2015.He currently is the co-head of the bank's private bank and retail-banking operations and regional chief executive officer of Germany, based in Frankfurt.

.Banks have a much different business model from most
companies. As financial institutions, banks produce no goods and
therefore don't have inventory. Yet what you
will

find on the balance sheet is essential to understanding the
financial health of a bank. Let's take a look at the items that
you can usually expect to see on a bank's balance sheet, with the
goal of helping you analyze banks that appear on your investing
watchlist.Understanding a bank's assetsThe hardest challenge in understanding a bank's balance sheet
is that from the bank's perspective, what's an asset and what's a
liability are the reverse of what you'd probably expect. For
instance, from the customer's viewpoint, it's easy to think that
a bank's biggest asset is the money that it holds for depositors.
Yet banks actually work hard to get rid of most of that money as
soon as it comes in, putting it to work in more profitable ways
that can generate a return.The most important asset at most banks are the loans it makes
to its customers. The reason loans are an asset is that the bank
expects repayment of the loan at a future date, and in the
meantime, it can often buy or sell loans between other banks if
it needs liquidity. At
Bank of America

, for instance, loans make up more than 40% of total assets.In addition to loans, banks also invest in various types of
securities. Government bonds are a popular choice among most
banks, but you can also find mortgage-backed securities and other
assets in the bank's trading accounts. Currently, total
investments make up about 30% of Bank of America's overall
assets.Source:

.Finally, banks hold some liquid cash, and you'll often find
other sorts of assets, such as real estate that the bank owns
both for its operations and from foreclosing on bad loans,
goodwill and other intangible assets, and items like deferred tax
assets that have value from an accounting standpoint. B of A has
about 15% of its assets in cash currently, with other assets
making up the remainder of the bank's assets.Usually, loans are the most profitable use of a bank's money,
with returns that generally exceed what it can earn on investment
securities. Yet extending loans to the right customers is
essential to a bank's success, as repayment risk plays the most
important role in whether a loan is good or bad. That's the
tension that drives lending policies at big financial
institutions.Balancing bank liabilitiesInteresting, many investors find the liability side of a
bank's balance sheet easier to understand. That's because you'll
find most of the products with which bank customers are familiar
there.Flickr

.The biggest portion of a bank's liabilities comes from deposit
accounts. At Bank of America, deposits make up about 60% of its
overall liabilities, with the majority of those deposits in
accounts that pay interest to their accountholders. Yet it's
important to understand that all interest-bearing deposits end up
in the same broad category on the balance sheet, that doesn't
tell you how
much

interest they pay -- for that, you have to go to the income
statement.Other than deposits, banks can also borrow money from other
sources. The Federal Reserve makes overnight and short-term loans
available to many banks, and banks can also issue longer-term
debt to investors.Finally, banks have expenses on their balance sheets that
they've accrued but not yet paid. At big banks, this item is
relatively small, with Bank of America's accrued expenses
amounting to less than 8% of total liabilities.What to watch forIn assessing the health of a bank's balance sheet, several
things stand out. Ideally, the greater the percentage of deposits
as liabilities, the more profitable a bank is likely to be. At
the same time, you should also look at shareholder equity -- the
difference between assets and liabilities -- as a sign of how
much leverage a bank has in its portfolio of loans. The greater
the ratio of assets to equity, the greater the risk if the bank's
loans go awry.Bank of America + Apple? This device makes it possible.

In contrast, JPMorgan Chase & Co'sgained 5 percent and Bank of America Corp'swas 4 percent higher.Those two banks attributed gains to opening offices and adding bankers in smaller cities around the country, a strategy Wells Fargo has embraced for decades. But as Wells struggles to recover from a sales scandal that has touched customers in businesses ranges from deposits, credit cards, mortgages and auto lending to wealth management, it has become harder for the bank to maintain its competitive edge.Chief Financial Officer John Shrewsberry said as much on Friday when an analyst asked whether Wells Fargo is losing any customers because of negative headlines.""We have to compete a little bit harder,"" he said, noting that rivals have been trying harder to steal business during Wells Fargo's time of vulnerability.Asked by Reuters about the decline in C&I lending specifically, Shrewsberry said that while Wells Fargo competes aggressively on pricing, it has been stricter about loan structures than other banks. For example, Wells might give a borrower a lower interest rate but would not offer a bigger loan or extend the duration or relax loan terms.Since 2010, JPMorgan has opened 52 new commercial lending offices, including in San Francisco, where Wells is based, as well as in Silicon Valley'sPalo Alto, Omaha, Nebraska, and Memphis, Tennessee. It has also hired as many as 100 commercial bankers each year, many of whom cater to companies with annual revenue of just $20 million to $500 million.Using a similar strategy, Bank of America has hired some 400 commercial bankers in recent years.Banks tend to forge long-lasting bonds with C&I borrowers that can lead to additional work, such as managing cash, handling payments, issuing corporate credit cards, raising money in capital markets and even advising on acquisitions. That makes Wells Fargo's market share decline particularly troubling, said Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Brian Kleinhanzl.""If you are winning the C&I piece, you are deepening the relationship, which is good for revenue growth,"" he said.The market share shift represents a change in fortune for Wells, which came through the 2007-2009 financial crisis strong enough to acquire a failing rival and avoid many of the embarrassing scandals that plagued other big banks.That changed in September 2016, when Wells reached a $190 million regulatory settlement over opening what turned out to be as many as 3.5 million phony customer accounts to hit sales targets. Since then, the No. 3 U.S. bank by assets has discovered several other problems and now faces another regulatory penalty of $1 billion.Executives have downplayed the scandal's impact on profitability or market share, saying Wells is ""open for business,"" and that few customers have left.But analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe the scandal is starting to hurt Wells Fargo's competitive edge, either because customers are displeased or because executives are too distracted by lawsuits, regulatory probes and organizational changes to run the bank as well as they otherwise would.""Obviously, management has been focused on the issues around the sales practices,"" said Allen Tischler, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service who has tracked the lost market share.Nonetheless, Wells' CFO Shrewsberry was optimistic about the outlook for C&I lending, which he expects to grow this year as commercial borrowers take on more leverage for expansion plans.Speaking about Wells Fargo's balance sheet more broadly, he said areas with sharp declines, like auto and home equity loans, are where the bank has purposefully pulled back because of credit concerns.""Our loan portfolio is getting safer and safer,"" he said, ""and it's smaller.""BofA profit beats estimates on higher interest rates, loan growthL3N1RT46T","Stocks,WorldMarkets,Politics","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Stocks Go on a Streaming Rally', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/stocks-go-on-a-streaming-rally-cm949335', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad6eec33efc2c3d06edfa87'}}, {'news_title': ""The Secret To Matching 2017's Gains In 2018"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/the-secret-to-matching-2017s-gains-in-2018-cm949339', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad6eec33efc2c3d06edfa88'}}, {'news_title': 'Report: Nearly Half of Drivers Are Skeptical About Self-Driving Cars', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/report-nearly-half-of-drivers-are-skeptical-about-self-driving-cars-cm949319', '_id': {'$oid': '5ad6eec33efc2c3d06edfa89'}}]","{'$date': '2018-04-17T07:00:00Z'}"

provided a bright spot in an otherwise disappointing fourth quarter
results for the nation's largest bank.The unit, which includes Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management,
U.S. Trust, Bank of America Private Wealth Management and Columbia
Management, reported net income of $1.3 billion, up from $1.1
billion the previous quarter.Net income from Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management alone was
$1.5 billion, up 22% from the previous year, while U.S. Trust
reported net income of $174 million. Columbia Management posted a
net loss of $7 million, BofA announced Wednesday.The combined unit also reported assets under management of $750
billion, which is an increase of $10 billion from previous quarter.
The bank said that improved market valuations and positive asset
flows generated by advisors were dragged down by outflows in
Columbia Management. Last September BofA agreed to sell Columbia to
TD Ameritrade for up to $1.2 Billion. The sale is due to close in
the second quarter.As Sallie Krawcheck, president of BofA's global wealth unit,
said during a conference call last week advisor attrition rates
during the fourth quarter were historically low. The bank reported
that it retained 94% of high-producing Merrill Lynch financial
advisors, and the overall number of advisors has stabilized at
around 15,000, up slightly from the previous quarter. Annualized
revenue per Merrill Lynch financial advisor was also up slightly
from the last quarter, at $830,000 per advisor.The bank also emphasized the success of its cross-selling
initiative, reporting that the commercial bank had received more
than 3100 referrals from Merrill Lynch financial advisors, and 41%
of Merrill advisors had sold banking products to their
customers.BofA said it generated cost savings of $1.1 billion from the
Merrill acquisition during the fourth quarter, to reach $3.3
billion in savings year-to-date, which the bank says is ""well
ahead"" of its initial estimates.Overall, the Charlotte-based banking company reported a
quarterly loss of $5.2 billion, or 60 cents per share, largely due
to costs associated with its repayment of $45 billion in Tarp
funds.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.© 2016 SourceMedia, Inc.

Securities & Exchange Commission was ""stunning"" and will haunt
the bank for years to come, according to one industry analyst.Monday, Judge Jed S. Rakoff from the U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York ""reluctantly approved"" the
$150 million settlement between the bank and the SEC regarding the
bank's disclosures of financial losses at Merrill Lynch prior to
the acquisition of the brokerage firm. Rakoff did not think the
settlement truly addressed the issues of fairness and public
interest, but he said that both sides had reminded him that the law
specifies that the SEC be given ""substantial deference"" as a
regulatory body.Under the current agreement, the SEC asked BofA to undertake
reforms pertaining to the bank's disclosure process in addition to
the multi-million penalty, according to the SEC's legal brief filed
earlier this month.Chip Roame, managing principal of Tiburon Strategic Advisors,
said the settlement essentially concedes that Bank of America [BAC]
had been wrong. The original proposal had called for the bank to
pay $33 million, but that was shot down by Rakoff.Roame says the new settlement also opens the door wider for New
York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo, who also filed suit against the
bank and former executives. Moreover, this also paves that way for
possible shareholder lawsuits, Roame says. Earlier this month, New
York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo's office also filed charges
against BofA as well as former chief executive Kenneth Lewis and
former chief financial officer Joseph Price for allegedly hiding
losses at Merrill Lynch before its acquisition of the brokerage
firm.According to that lawsuit, Bank of America's management
intentionally failed to disclose massive losses at Merrill before
shareholders approved the acquisition. Moreover, once the deal was
approved, management then allegedly manipulated the federal
government into granting a massive taxpayer bailout, according to
the complaint. Cuomo's suit is still pending.Bank of America did not respond to any of these latest comments,
but it did say Monday in an email that is was ""pleased that the
settlement with the SEC has been approved.""The Attorney General's office did not respond to a phone call
about its suit against BofA, but an article in 
The Wall Street Journal

 blog said that while the new settlement sends some ""mixed
signals"" about Cuomo's suit, his office was ""quick to declare the
ruling bolstered its case.""Last September, Judge Rakoff had rejected the proposed
settlement of $33 million, partly on the grounds that it was unfair
to BofA's shareholders. This time, according to other press
reports, he demanded that the settlement be adjusted so that funds
would be distributed specifically to the legacy BofA shareholders
harmed by the non-disclosures and not the Merrill Lynch
shareholders. The judge also asked the SEC and the bank to include
a provision, which had already been agreed upon, for the SEC to
have a say in the hiring of an independent auditor to assess
whether the bank's accounting controls and procedures are
adequate.The court action stems from BofA's $50 billion acquisition of
Merrill Lynch at the height of the financial crisis in the fall of
2008 and the failure of management to disclose massive losses at
Merrill before shareholders approved the deal. The SEC has
maintained that senior management and in-house counsel ""erroneously
concluded that no disclosure was necessary because the projected
quarterly loss was within the range of losses that Merrill had
sustained in the preceding five quarters.""The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.Â© 2016 SourceMedia, Inc.

Active investors and traders could now look to bet on a continuation of this upside momentum in BAC stock.While the broader stock market can rally for periods at a time without sponsorship of the financial sector, at the margin the rallies feel steadier and more sustainable when banking stocks participate.As a result I always keep a close eye on the banking stocks and one index I follow is the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 week, blue - 100 week, yellow - 50 weekOn the first chart, I plotted BAC stock on top and the BKX index at the bottom in blue. Here we see that after a few weeks of consolidating within the middle part of the up-trending channel (black parallels), the stock last week attempted a marginal breakout of the range as marked by the  blue box.10 Best Stocks Under $10The stock had a so-called bullish outside week last week through the lens of candlestick analysis, which is to say that after initially trading lower, the stock rallied back to finish the week strong and above the previous week's highs. Although the stock remains below the intra-week highs from two weeks ago, the effort was notably strong in other large-cap banking institutions as well.The blue line at the bottom of the chart represents a ratio of the BKX index versus the S&P 500 . Here we see that although no breakout occurred last week, banking stocks are still trading relatively strong versus the S&P 500, which is an encouraging sign for the group and financial stocks as a sector.Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 day, blue - 100 day, yellow - 50 dayOn the daily chart, we see that last Friday's rally pushed BAC stock marginally out of the multiweek consolidation phase on a daily closing basis.From here, without making things too complicated active traders and investors could look to buy the stock for a next upside target in the $34-$35 zone, which is close to the upper end of the trading channel outlined in the above weekly chart.Any strong daily bearish reversal, particularly if also felt in the broader financial sector would call for a stop loss on this swing trade.Check out Serge's Daily Market Outlook for March 12.Tell us what you think about this article!

The consensus calls for earnings of $0.35 for the quarter, up from $0.21 during the same period last year. BAC shares have risen a modest 1.7% on the year.BAC was recently trading at $22.50, down $3.30 from its 12-month high and $10.45 above its 12-month low. Overall technical indicators for BAC are bullish with a strong upward trend. The stock has recent support above $22.50, and recent resistance below $23.90. Of the 20 analysts who cover the stock, 12 rate it a ""strong buy"", two rate it a ""buy"", and six rate it a ""hold"". The stock receives S&P Capital IQ's 4 STARS ""Buy"" ranking.Like all the major bank stocks, Bank of America ( BAC) moved strongly higher following the presidential election. President Trump promised to ease regulations that were put in place during the financial crisis, and to bring tax reform that would spur economic growth. Both promises will greatly benefit the sector, as will rising interest rates. Whether or not Trump is able to deliver on his promises remains to be seen, but rates have started to rise. The Federal Reserve boosted rates in December, and then again in March, which should result in higher earnings for banks. Analysts have BAC pegged for 16.7% earnings growth in 2017, and an additional 21.1% in 2018. Despite the big growth estimates, BAC continues to trade at a reasonable valuation, with a P/E of 15.1, which suggest the stock has additional upside, and limited downside, as long as nothing serious pops up in the quarterly report.If you want a bullish hedged trade on the stock, consider a July 15/20 bull-put credit spread for a 35-cent credit.

The kind where you sleep well at night, travel freely and still have money left over to help out your kids and grandkids... It's very unlikely that you'll be able to generate enough income for that lifestyle through simply stocks and bonds.Consider this…You Know What You Want
 To keep more of your own money. Make better than average returns... and fewer mistakes. VectorVest makes it easy to make better decisions. To stay in control as the markets move up and down, with at-a-glance guidance on what and when to buy, sell and hold. Analyze any stock free. Get your free report .Let's say you collect Social Security, but you estimate that you'll need an additional $45,000 a year in income to maintain a comfortable standard of living in your golden years. That means, with a $250,000 portfolio, you'd need to generate around 18% annual returns just to pay yourself without losing any capital. With a $500,000 portfolio, you'd need about 9%.If you have more than that, you're in a better position, but there are still many future costs that could drain your nest egg in a hurry.But what if I told you that there's a way to earn additional income -- as high as, say, $1,400 a month -- from stocks you already own? Even better, what I'm about to tell you is one of the safest income-producing strategies around, and it's been used by people ""in the know"" for decades.Before I reveal exactly what it is I'm talking about, let me give you an analogy...Most people would think it foolish to own an investment property and not rent it out. After all, if you owned an $80,000 apartment in Boston, Houston or Seattle, you'd be able to collect about $500 a month in rent, depending on the neighborhood.Sounds like a no-brainer, right?Likewise, if you owned $80,000 worth of stock in companies like Apple, Facebook or Intel, you could essentially do the same thing. That's because the stocks in your brokerage account can also generate monthly income, much like a rental property. But unlike with real estate, most people don't take advantage of this with their stocks.When you think about it this way, it's utterly unbelievable that more people aren't doing this.The good news is that collecting additional income on your stocks isn't difficult. In fact, you can do it with blocks of just 100 shares, with nearly every stock listed on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.See, many investors simply hold stocks in their investment accounts and hope that their dividends and capital gains will be enough.But you can do better than that by using an incredibly safe strategy that lets you make a deal with other traders who want to pay you cash upfront -- money you can funnel into your brokerage account -- for the opportunity to buy your stock from you at a higher price.To be absolutely clear: Someone will pay you cash for the opportunity to buy your stock at a higher price than it is trading for today. You also get to set the price at which you would be willing to sell your shares. If the shares don't trade for that agreed upon price within a certain time frame then you get to keep the cash they paid... and your shares.Sounds too good to be true, right? Don't be fooled: it's real and it works. I use this strategy myself to generate extra money for my day-to-day living costs. It can cover your monthly bills... medical expenses... even provide you with additional income for the things you otherwise couldn't afford, like taking lavish vacations.However you choose to use this money, it's one of the safest ways to generate extra income from the stocks you already have in your portfolio. In fact, I can't think of a better strategy for retirees looking to boost their income.Lower Your Risk, Boost Your Income
 ​ The strategy I'm talking about is an ""options"" strategy. But don't worry, it's completely unlike any risky options trading you may have heard about.In fact, this strategy is the main risk reduction technique used by wealthy people and professional money managers to safeguard their wealth. For them, the main purpose is to reduce the risk of holding such large quantities of stock. The fact that this strategy also produces income in the process is an added bonus.But for ordinary investors like you and me, both of these benefits are equally important.Like I said, this is an especially great source of money if you're retired, approaching retirement, or just want to boost your monthly income. Even The Wall Street Journal says, ""[It] generates income and can juice your returns in any market.""The technique is called ""selling covered calls"" or ""covered call writing.""Here's how I explain covered calls to new readers of my premium newsletter, Maximum Income .A call option is simply the right -- but not the obligation -- to buy a stock at a specified price before a specified date. Selling a covered call obligates us to sell that stock to the call buyer if it moves above a specified price (the option's ""strike price""). When we accept that obligation, we receive instant income upfront (known as a ""premium""). You can be asked to sell the stock at any time between the moment you collect the premium and the expiration of the option contract. To minimize risk, we will only sell calls on stocks that we own 100 shares of -- that's what makes it a ""covered"" call.Now perhaps the best way to understand how this works is to give you an example.My Maximum Income readers and I recently made a covered call trade on Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) .If you want to know why I like owning the company in today's environment, then I encourage you to read this essay I recently wrote in StreetAuthority Daily. But suffice it to say, with interest rates on the rise, I think the major banks -- and BAC in particular -- are poised to do well for investors.There is, of course, just one problem. At a yield of 2%, the income produced from owning BAC leaves a little more to be desired for most investors. That's where covered calls come in.Also keep in mind that I did not reveal the exact details of the trade in that StreetAuthority Daily piece. That information is normally reserved for my Maximum Income subscribers. I am, however, going to make an exception today, so you can see exactly what I mean when I say it's the best bet for investors looking to supplement their income.My Recent Trade On BAC
 When I originally issued this recommendation, BAC was trading around $25.50. So I recommend that my Maximum Income readers buy 100 shares of BAC and then sell one BAC Dec 27 Call for every 100 shares of BAC they purchased. That's a call option on BAC with a strike price of $27 that expires on Dec. 15.At the time, the BAC Dec 27 Calls were trading around $0.28 per share. The goal was to enter this trade at a cost basis of $25.45 or less. Your cost basis is simply the price you purchase shares at minus the premium per share received when selling the call.Keep in mind, it's possible that both the stock and the call option will be trading for slightly different prices than what you see in the trade example below; that's OK. As long as you can enter this trade for a cost basis below $25.45, I recommend executing the covered call trade. (BAC shares have bounced upward a bit recently, but the stock could pull back a bit and allow you room to enter this trade.)This call will obligate you to sell BAC at $27 a share if the stock trades above that on Dec. 15 (the last day these options can be traded).This December, BAC is expected to pay a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share. While this dividend has not yet been officially declared, over the past four years, BAC has consistently set the record date for very early December -- usually the first few days of the month -- and I have no doubt that we'll see the same pattern this year. An early December record date would occur before our option expires. Since we'll already own 100 shares of BAC at that date, we'll qualify to receive the distribution payment regardless of whether our call option eventually expires worthless; as such, I'm including it in the total income this trade will generate.If the option expires ""worthless,"" then that's a good thing. Assuming BAC trades for $27 or less on Dec. 15, we'd keep the $40 we received from the premium and distribution on $2,550, earning 1.6% in 64 days. If we can repeat a similar trade every 64 days, we'd earn a 9% return on our capital in 12 months.If BAC trades above $27, then our shares will be called. In that case, we will sell the shares for $27. In this case, we'd realize a profit of $1.67 per share ($27 minus the $25.33 cost basis), or $167 per 100 shares. This is a profit of 6.6% in 64 days. If we can repeat a similar trade every 64 days, we'd earn a 38% return on our cost basis in 12 months.I know there are a lot of numbers I threw out there, but hopefully you understand that what we're essentially talking about here is a ""win-win"". Either a potential 9% yearly income stream on a stock that only yields 2%... or a 38% return in 12 months.Frankly, I'm happy to take either. That's why thousands of investors have joined me over at Maximum Income . Like you, they're not content to simply accept the income offered by traditional stocks and bonds. Honestly, in this low-rate environment, it's just not going to cut it.That's why I'm happy to tell you about my research report, which explains how covered calls work, and how you can use it to generate hundreds -- even thousands -- of dollars per month, no matter whether the stock market is moving up, down or sideways.

While oil stocks returned to Earth, financials were flying high. Perhaps the biggest bank stock reveling in the gains is Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ), which has already climbed 2.20% yesterday. With the BAC stock uptrend now reaffirmed, bull trades are worth a shot.The timing of today's jump was fortuitous. Recent selling pressures were threatening to reverse BofA's uptrend. Over the past six trading sessions, BAC shed 5% of value falling all the way to the 50-day moving average.Chart watchers often view a break of this indicator as a negative omen signaling a trend reversal. Remaining above the 50-day keeps a stock in the good graces of bulls everywhere.9 Must-Own Stocks That Have Paid Over a Century of DividendsThe high volume accompanying BAC's decline was also worrisome. Remember, high volume down days suggest distribution or widespread selling by institutions which often weighs on a stock for days to come. If yesterday's sharp rebound sticks, it will mostly negate the damage dealt by the distribution.If this is the beginning of BofA's next advance, then there's no time like the present to deploy bullish trades.With the return of volatility, the premium in BAC stock options is getting juiced once more. And that's increasing the appeal of short premium strategies like the naked put.The stock's cheap price tag ($26) will keep the margin cost for the trade minimal which creates a more attractive return on investment.Sell the Dec $26 put for 43 cents. If the stock remains above $26 for the next month, the put will expire worthless allowing you to pocket the max reward of 43 cents.That may not sound like a lot, but the initial cost of the trade is only $455, so we're looking at a potential 9.5% return on investment. That's decent cash flow for one month's worth of work.As of this writing, Tyler Craig didn't hold positions in any of the aforementioned securities. Want more education on how to trade?

Due to its importance, large banks and other financial market participants hedge their exposure to interest rates.For now, the Fed has set the rate at 1% to 1.25%. The futures market is already pricing in a rate of 1.25% to 1.5% after the next meeting, which is scheduled for Dec. 13.As rates go up, there will be winners and losers. Unfortunately, consumers could be among the biggest losers. Many credit card companies tie their rate to Fed policy, and car loans and mortgages are also likely to cost more.On the other end of the spectrum, we have banks, which should benefitfrom higher interest rates. One of the most important sources of a bank's profits is the margin it charges on loans. This is the difference between the rate the bank pays to borrow money and the rate it charges when it lends money. At its most basic level, a bank's business model is to borrow money at short-term rates and lend it out at higher, long-term rates.As rates rise, banks can increase the size of their margins, and studies have found that higher rates boost banks' profits. The average net interest margins are higher in high-rate environments than in low-rate environments. Profitability, measured by return on assets, is also higher in high-rate environments.This Banking Giant Is Turning Itself Around With rates almost certain to rise, this means that banks are among the best investments in the market right now. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC)offers a high-income opportunity in the sector.Bank of America serves clients of all sizes, from the small individual consumer all the way up to corporations and even governments. It also offers a range of services, including banking, investing, asset management and other financial and risk management products. In total, Bank of America has assets of $2.25 trillion and deposits of $1.26 trillion.The company's presence across the country is widespread, with approximately 4,500 retail financial centers and 16,000 ATMs. Digital banking serves approximately 34 million active users, including 23 million mobile users.Over the past few years, Bank of America has taken steps to diversify its operations, ensuring it can withstand potential financial crises. Today, the company's U.S.-based banking business accounts for 37.5% of total revenue while global banking (operations outside of the United States) accounts for 22% of sales. Global Wealth & Investment management, the company's private wealth management segment, represents about 21% of revenue, and Global Markets -- the division responsible for trading, market-making, financing, securities clearing, settlement and custody, and risk management -- provides about 19% of the company's revenue.As a result, the company has changed from a highly leveraged, risky bank to a relatively stable, conservative bank. But while stability often goes hand-in-hand with slow growth, there are two potential catalysts for Bank of America to boost growth.One of those two catalysts is higher interest rates, and the positive impact that should have on BAC's bottom line. In fact, the results from this are already showing up in the income statement as an improvement in the company's net interest income.The second catalyst is the company's focus on reducing expenses. Management launched a cost reduction effort in 2011, known as Project New BAC. The results were immediate. By the end of 2014, operating expenses were reduced by $8 billion and the trend towards lower expenses continued for the next two years. Expenses have remained constant for the first half of this year, demonstrating the culture of the company has been changed.Regulators agree that BAC is moving in the right direction. One reason we know this is because large banks have to secure approval for their dividends and buybacks every year, and, this year, regulators approved a 60% dividend hike and $12 billion share repurchase authorization (through the third quarter 2018).BAC is an excellent investment in the current, high-risk market environment.Despite all of the positive developments in the past few years, Bank of America remains undervalued when compared to its peers. Its current price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-book (P/B) ratios are lower than the industry averages. Its dividend yield is also lower than average.Given the relative stability among big banks, I believe the industry -- and BAC in particular -- should be valued for its safety, and its ability to generate income for shareholders. But at a yield of 2%, I wouldn't blame the average investor for wanting more. That's why I recently told my Maximum Incomereaders about a way to generate even more income than with the dividend alone. In fact, if we can repeat this trade throughout a year, we'd earn a 9% income stream -- far higher than the mere 2% BAC pays in dividends.And while I can't give away the specific details of the trade here, I can tell you that it has to do with covered calls. For those who aren't aware, covered calls are one of the most conservative ways of generating income around -- so much so that it's been called safe enough ""for widows and orphans.""

traveled a lot. So I learned to be adaptable and I developed an
appreciation for a global mindset.As a teen, I worked in a fast-food restaurant to save money for
college. The seeds of my interest in finance were planted there.
The owner worked alongside his employees, and I watched and
learned. I was fascinated by his pride of ownership and
entrepreneurial spirit.I graduated from the University of Redlands in southern
California with a degree in business. I was also a voracious reader
and especially enjoyed reading about Sir John Templeton, Warren
Buffett and Lee Iacocca. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, there
was a lot written about hostile takeovers, corporate turnarounds
and emerging markets. Reading about the importance of leadership
and its impact on the direction and ultimate outcome of an
organization was fascinating.The first stock I bought was AT&T. Following the divestiture
of the Baby Bells, I ended up owning stock in the spinoffs and was
constantly calling my Merrill Lynch advisor about them. My wife
Kathy knew I was more interested in what he was doing than in my
own job in commercial insurance. She told me about an upcoming
Merrill Lynch career night and suggested I attend. I was hired in
August 1987 as an advisor in the San Bernardino office. After
holding various managerial positions, I assumed my current position
in January 2009.My current role is multi-faceted. We're navigating a difficult
economy and I'm helping to lead our wealth management organization
through a complex integration with Bank of America. When all else
fails, it's important to stick to the facts, not what you think you
know. It helps everyone rally.I'm also focused on the restoration of trust in the industry.
The majority of advisors are deeply committed to assisting people
with their financial needs, but their efforts have often been
overshadowed by the macro challenges of the last couple of years.
We need to recognize the importance of their good work and figure
out more ways to share their contributions with the public.In my free time I'm a sports junkie. I used to run marathons,
but the past few years, I've followed my children's sports instead.
I've watched my son play football and my oldest daughter swim. My
youngest daughter plays volleyball for Carnegie Mellon.I also enjoy splitting wood. It's a great time for thinking and
also relieves stress. I get satisfaction from starting with a pile
of wood in the morning which is all split hours later. Not much of
life is that uncomplicated.As told to Pat Olsen.The views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.© 2016 SourceMedia, Inc.

She did not mention Remington.Bank of America's plans to go ahead with the credit facility following its change of policy in April have not previously been reported.Bank of America said it does not comment on client matters.Representatives for Remington and Cerberus Capital Management L.P., Remington's private equity owner, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Cerberus will give up its equity stake in Remington under the weapons maker's bankruptcy plan.According to a review of bankruptcy court documents and interviews with restructuring experts, Bank of America's agreement with Remington allows it to back out and find another lender to cover its commitment.But withdrawing from the deal would hurt the bank's reputation for standing by its lending agreements and could undermine Remington's survival, according to one person familiar with the bank's thinking.Noting that the credit facility is part of a court-supervised bankruptcy, the source said that if the bank were to pull out of the deal it could expose itself to lawsuits and potential damages.Remington makes the Bushmaster assault-style rifle, including the one used in the Sandy Hook school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults.At Bank of America's annual shareholder meeting in April, Chairman and Chief Executive Brian Moynihan said the change of policy toward some gun makers was prompted in part because more than 150 Bank of America employees ""directly lost a relative in the shootings in the last couple years.""Moynihan was responding to conservative activist and shareholder Justin Danhof, who said at the meeting that the bank has an obligation to its investors to make profitable loans.""The company is willfully giving up money,"" Danhof said of the guns pledge.Remington has been a client of Bank of America and the six other lenders providing the credit facility since at least 2012, according to court records.The other banks declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.In the weeks leading up to Remington's bankruptcy, 30 other potential lenders turned down requests for help from Remington's financial adviser, many of them citing firearms as the reason, according to court documents.One corporate restructuring specialist suggested Bank of America could have used the new credit facility as leverage to demand that Remington stop making assault-style rifles.""It's perfectly reasonable for them to say to any borrower, 'We're happy to lend to you if you don't make military-style assault weapons,'"" said Ted Gavin of the Gavin/Solmonese LLC restructuring advisory firm. ""The lender has all the power.""","Stocks,WorldMarkets,BankingandLoans","BAC","[{'news_title': '3 Dividend Stocks Perfect for Retirees', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-dividend-stocks-perfect-for-retirees-cm960160', '_id': {'$oid': '5af1b8d93efc2c2b5da0641e'}}, {'news_title': 'Alnylam Looks Forward', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/alnylam-looks-forward-cm960164', '_id': {'$oid': '5af1b8d93efc2c2b5da0641f'}}, {'news_title': ""RigNet Inc's Revenue Rises as Its Site Count Increases"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/rignet-incs-revenue-rises-as-its-site-count-increases-cm960168', '_id': {'$oid': '5af1b8d93efc2c2b5da06420'}}]","{'$date': '2018-05-07T07:00:00Z'}"

This move was largely led by the energy stocks as a result of rising oil prices, but the second-best-performing group of the day were financials. Stocks such as&nbsp; Bank of America Corp &nbsp;(NYSE: BAC ) now are getting back on their feet after a choppy first quarter. Specifically for BAC stock a next upside target is well defined,&nbsp; just as a stop loss level.Every time I discuss a banking stock or other financial company, I stress the importance of the financial sector as a group for the broader stock market. The financial stocks currently make up close to 15% of the S&P 500 , which is the second-largest weighting behind technology, which makes up close to 28% of the index. Thus simply from a pure index-weighting perspective, financials cannot be ignored. Add in this sector's importance to the economy and close ties to movements in interest rates and you have a crucial part of the stock market that often gives leading signals and thus juicy trading opportunities.Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 week, blue - 100 week, yellow - 50 weekOn the multiyear weekly chart of BAC stock, we see that the uptrend from the second half of 2016 remains intact (blue line) despite the fact that the stock has done nothing worth writing home about since December 2017. But this is exactly where the importance of a multi time frame analysis approach shines … this perspective is crucial beyond anything else.7 Cheap Stocks With Strong Technical SignalsFrom a weekly candlestick perspective, note that last week's candlestick closed well off the intraweek lows and held horizontal support from earlier in the year.&nbsp;Although this trading week is not yet over, note that we are so far seeing what I refer to as follow-through buying and a nice green candle.Should this rally hold up to close this week then from this bigger picture angle upside back of the March highs for BAC stock looks to be in the cards.Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 day, blue - 100 day, yellow - 50&nbsp;dayOn the daily chart we see that the rally so far this week has already come on a few up-gaps and three up-days in a row. From an immediate term perspective BAC stock could indeed now have reached overbought conditions. However, taking into consideration the bigger picture analysis of the above chart, the stock may just be getting started for a better rally.Note that around the $30-$31 area BAC stock has confluence resistance made up of its 50-day and 100-day moving averages as well as horizontal resistance from April. Once this area can be overcome then I see next upside toward $33. Ultimately, if and when $33 can be overcome then the mid to&nbsp; high $30's are next.Tell us what you think about this article!

However, a big price move all by itself doesn't tell us much about any stock's future potential.With that in mind, let's take a look at why Bank of America's stock has performed so well and if the future growth potential justifies the now-higher price tag.Bank of America's emphasis on banking technology is paying off. Image source: Bank of America.Since the financial crisis ended roughly a decade ago, Bank of America has done an excellent job of reducing its risk and responsibly building its business.Bank of America's business has grown steadily and responsibly in terms of deposits, loans, brokerage assets, and most other areas of the bank's business. However, the change that I'm most excited about is the bank's emphasis on improving efficiency.Over the past several years, Bank of America has invested heavily in building out its technology platforms, such as its mobile app, and has been strategically reducing its physical footprint by closing underperforming or unnecessary branches. In simple terms, it is much more cost-effective to have customers use digital banking services than to visit a branch. For example, when you factor in the cost of facilities, employees, paper, and other items, a mobile check deposit costs a bank roughly one-tenthof what a teller-processed deposit does.The efforts have paid off. Bank of America's efficiency ratio has fallen (lower is better) from 69% at the end of 2015 to a far more respectable 60% today. In other words, the bank is spending $9 less for every $100 in revenue it generates than it did just a few years ago. At the scale of Bank of America's business, this makes a bigdifference.And, thanks to a combination of the improving efficiency and the benefits of corporate tax reform, Bank of America has finally surpassed the industry profitability benchmarks of 10% return on equity and 1% return on assets. This would have seemed like a crazy thought in the wake of the financial crisis, and simply put, it's impressive at how effectively the bank has transformed itself.The bank's fantastic improvement is reflected in its stock performance. For 2017, the bank handily outperformed its peer group, with a total return of 35.7% versus 20.3% for the other big U.S. banks.In addition, Bank of America is emphasizing its return of capital to shareholders. During 2017 alone, Bank of America bought back $11.9 billion worth of stock and paid $4 billion out as dividends. Given the bank's growth and profitability, I'd be surprised if both figures didn't get even higher in 2018 after the bank's capital plan is reviewed by the Federal Reserve.I already mentioned tax reform, and since the new 21% corporate tax rate is one of the few permanent tax changes, this should help keep Bank of America's profits elevated for the foreseeable future.Another thing that could bump Bank of America's profits to the next level is rising interest rates. With a higher-than-average concentration on noninterest-bearing deposits, Bank of America stands to benefit more than most as interest rates rise. In fact, the bank's management has said that a 100-basis-point (1%) parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve could translate to an additional $3 billion in annual net interest income.Additionally, the most powerful catalyst could be the continuous improvement of the U.S. economy. A strong job market with significant wage growth should translate to increased demand for loan and deposit products, investment accounts, and more, which could drive banking revenue much higher over the next few years.Bank of America has produced a 168% total return over the past five years, so it may seem like the stock has gotten a bit overheated. However, the bank's performance more than justifies the current stock price. In fact, based on first quarter earnings, Bank of America is trading for a P/E ratio of just 12.5, and the bank still trades for a significant price-to-book discount when compared with JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, and even scandal-plagued Wells Fargo.In a nutshell, even though Bank of America has been one of the best performers in a hot financial sector, the stock still looks like a good buy now.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The buyback is due to wrap up by the end of next year.""For Novartis shareholders, this should at last feel like a win,"" said Andy Smith, analyst at Edison Investment Research. ""Actually, two wins"" with the share buyback, he added.Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, a Harvard-trained U.S. doctor, is pressing ahead with Jimenez's reversal of a decade of expansion under Vasella, the former CEO and chairman (graphic).Since Vasella's departure in 2013, Novartis has exited vaccines, dumped its animal health business and this year unloaded its consumer health joint venture with GlaxoSmithKlinefor around $13 billion.""A company like ours needs to focus our capital in our area of strength which I believe is innovating world class medicines and I'd like to build our strength in digital and data technologies,"" Narasimhan told reporters.NARASIMHAN REFOCUSESSince last year, Novartis has focused on building specialised treatments, buying U.S.-based Avexis for $8.7 billion and French-based Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) for $3.9 billion, giving it a platform in gene therapy and radiopharmaceuticals, respectively.Novartis has also been investing in digital technology, including a mobile app, which it will retain, to collect eye disease data from trials of its prescription ophthalmic medicines, which include blockbuster hopeful RTH258 against macular degeneration.Narasimhan said Novartis will continue to seek bolt-on acquisitions that boost technology or bring novel medicines that have the potential to transform treatment.""We have a strong balance sheet, we have strong free cash flow, so we are able to still execute our M&A strategy ... like we've done with AAA and Avexis,"" he said.Alcon makes surgical equipment to treat cataracts and contact lenses, businesses that no longer fit with Novartis.Alcon still faces a U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its business practices in Russia and Asia, both before and after Novartis bought Alcon from Nestle.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS are handling the Alcon spin-off, which will see Alcon head Mike Ball become its chairman and David Endicott its CEO.

The buyback is due to wrap up by the end of next year.""For Novartis shareholders, this should at last feel like a win,"" said Andy Smith, analyst at Edison Investment Research. ""Actually, two wins"" with the share buyback, he added.Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan, a Harvard-trained U.S. doctor, is pressing ahead with Jimenez's reversal of a decade of expansion under Vasella, the former CEO and chairman (graphic).Since Vasella's departure in 2013, Novartis has exited vaccines, dumped its animal health business and this year unloaded its consumer health joint venture with GlaxoSmithKlinefor around $13 billion.""A company like ours needs to focus our capital in our area of strength which I believe is innovating world class medicines and I'd like to build our strength in digital and data technologies,"" Narasimhan told reporters.NARASIMHAN REFOCUSESSince last year, Novartis has focused on building specialised treatments, buying U.S.-based Avexis for $8.7 billion and French-based Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) for $3.9 billion, giving it a platform in gene therapy and radiopharmaceuticals, respectively.Novartis has also been investing in digital technology, including a mobile app, which it will retain, to collect eye disease data from trials of its prescription ophthalmic medicines, which include blockbuster hopeful RTH258 against macular degeneration.Narasimhan said Novartis will continue to seek bolt-on acquisitions that boost technology or bring novel medicines that have the potential to transform treatment.""We have a strong balance sheet, we have strong free cash flow, so we are able to still execute our M&A strategy ... like we've done with AAA and Avexis,"" he said.Alcon makes surgical equipment to treat cataracts and contact lenses, businesses that no longer fit with Novartis.Alcon still faces a U.S. Department of Justice and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into its business practices in Russia and Asia, both before and after Novartis bought Alcon from Nestle.Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS are handling the Alcon spin-off, which will see Alcon head Mike Ball become its chairman and David Endicott its CEO.

""I don't think it has changed much, although firms are working hard to improve their gender ratios.""The firm, which works for many leading investment banks and conducts studies on behalf of its clients, found women generally account for 12 to 15 percent of trading roles, he said.There are no industry-wide data but the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees U.S. brokerages, said women accounted for about 28 percent of individuals registered with it at the end of 2017. Those numbers include not just traders, but also investment advisers.Banks' efforts to change that have intensified over the past year with the emergence of the #MeToo movement and growing shareholder calls for disclosures on workforce diversity.For example, Citigroup Incand Bank of America Corpreleased information on diversity and gender pay gap for the first time this year in response to calls from an investment advisory firm.Since last year, major employers have also been obliged to report gender pay gap data for their British operations, which for banks showed women underrepresented in higher earning roles.COACHING, NETWORKING AND MENTORINGBarclays' Sophomore Springboard program that Karani supports is one of several initiatives banks have introduced recently to make trading rooms more diverse.Citigroup Inc does college recruitment focused on informing young women about trading careers and offers them interview coaching, while JPMorgan Chase & Cohas been running an internal program for the past two years called Women Who Trade, which offers networking for female traders of all levels, including potential recruits.""We are doing a better job at ensuring analyst classes have a better intake (of women),"" said Claudia Jury, global co-head of currencies and emerging markets at JPMorgan and a senior sponsor for the program. The bank has hired around 30 women through the program since 2016, it said.Goldman Sachs Group Incstarted its Trader Academy in London last year, offering eight months of mentoring, networking and job shadowing for 16 female college students. The bank plans to expand the program to the Americas this year and Asia soon after.Goldman has said it wants women to eventually make up half of its overall workforce, but acknowledges trading is far from that goal.""Having women in particular from a trading perspective has always been a challenge for us,"" said Janine Glasenberg, the bank's head of graduate recruiting in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.Banks are so keen to improve their diversity ratios that one declined to make young female traders available for interviews out of fear they might get poached by competitors.Shareholder pressure aside, managers and some studies say hiring more women simply makes business sense.David Hesketh, chief executive of a London-based startup TradingHub said trading simulations the company ran in 2014 and 2015 for hundreds of interns as part of banks' recruitment programs showed women made fewer trades and took fewer risks, They would also break the rules less than half as often as men. In all, having more women on a team could translate into savings on brokerage fees, loss provisions and fines.""That is kind of nuts, if you think some firms are getting fines in the hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Hesketh said.BOYS CLUB VIBEYet former female traders interviewed by Reuters describe an industry, which has left behind discriminatory attitudes common only a decade ago, but where women remain heavily outnumbered and can sometimes feel like outsiders in a ""boys' club.""Simmy Grover, who worked as an equity trader at Morgan Stanley in London between 2006 and 2009, recalled how just over a decade ago one investment bank was ready to offer her a job, but just could not imagine her on the trading floor.""I remember walking into an interview and I was asked why I had applied for trading because I was a woman and I should be applying to sales.""Grover, now a researcher at the University College London, said she ended up working as a trader elsewhere anyway. While she said she never felt marginalized on the job, she would sometimes get overlooked by brokers hosting social events- typically involving watching a soccer game and a trip to the pub.Divya Krishnan, who was a trader between 2009 and 2014 as part of Citi's program for quantitative analysts, said in her time the bank was already trying to help young recruits, offering networking opportunities and linking them up with experienced female traders.They told them, she recalls, to be confident and avoid apologizing too much, something she said women tended to do.But like Grover she found it was harder to fit in after hours. ""I was never a sports person, but that was always a topic of conversation. I had to learn that,"" Krishnan, who now works for fintech startup Motif, said.While workplace culture is slow to change, banks focus their outreach in colleges on broadening a pool of potential candidates by dispelling the myth that only math wizards or those with finance degrees can succeed in trading.""We spend a lot of the time encouraging women who have liberal arts backgrounds to look at this business,"" said Amanda Magliaro, a managing director and head of global structured finance distribution at Citigroup.Magliaro, who graduated as a Japanese language major and holds an MBA in finance, said the efforts, including interview coaching for women joining its internship program, were bearing fruit: ""It has improved the numbers.""Headhunters say, however, it will take time before effects of such efforts show up in banks' gender ratios.""Firms would like to have more women in trading and other areas, but there aren't that many women in the pipeline.""

In short, yours truly here felt that years of belt-tightening and a some stress-test flops had made BofA a lean, mean banking machine. Fanning the bullish flames for BAC stock was a looming backdrop of rising interest rates.Since that early-September-2016 call, BAC shares have rallied 65%; you'll get no complaints from me. Thing is, as fruitful as this suggestion has been thus far, they may be on the verge of getting a whole lot better. Two charts say why.Just for the record, here's my first definitive look at Bank of America, from September 2nd of last year. I followed up here and here , and a few other times as well. Clearly I'm a fan.More important though, you may want to become a fan sooner than later as well.There are a couple of things going on that work in favor of BAC here, both of which can be plotted on a chart. The first of these is the Federal Reserve's so-called ""dot plot"" of forecasted interest rate increases.In mid-September traders were given a dose of news they weren't quite sure what to do with. Rather than the next rate hike coming in March of next year, it's now projected to materialize in December. The general consensus is, the economy is heating up a little faster than initially suspected, and the Fed is feeling pressed to tap the brakes before inflation soars out of control.It's not the next increase in interest rates that bode so well for BAC stock, however. It's the six other quarter-point rate hikes projected by the end of 2020.Click to EnlargeTop 10 Best Stocks to Buy in the S&P 500 Through Q3See, usually once the interest rate ball gets rolling, it remains in motion. This week's surprising upward revision in Q2's GDP growth rate  to 3.1%  underscores just how quickly and unexpectedly growth kicked in again.Higher interest rates generally translate into higher earnings on bank loans, as lenders charge more without the cost of that capital necessarily costing banks more. Though this is clearly a ""long game,"" for newcomers to BAC stock, it's a long game worth playing.That being said, newcomers might not have to wait too terribly long to start reaping some sort of reward.While BAC may be up 65% since early September, it really hasn't made any net progress since February of this year. Instead, it's just been edging sideways in something of a sideways trading range. A closer inspection of the weekly chart of BAC stock below, though, makes it clear the stock is working on wiggling its way out of that range in a bullish direction. In fact, it already has. With the recent runup, the technical ceiling at $25.40 has been further weakened.Click to EnlargeIn retrospect, the sideways action since early this year may have just been a consolidation phase, setting the stage for a breakout thrust that may have just gotten underway.The 10 Best Stocks for 2017 Contest -- The Experts Pull Into the Homestretch!As for targets, that's tougher to pinpoint right now. The forward-looking P/E of 11.8 leaves some room for more upside, though it's likely the earnings estimates that lead to that projected P/E underestimate how well Bank of America will do next year.Regardless, this is a long-term idea, with rate hikes in the cards through 2020. It's just too soon to peg a meaningful price target for BofA. As long as rates continue to rise, Bank of America should do increasingly better.

Among the stocks rallying was  Bank of America Corp  (NYSE: BAC ), which as a result bounced off a well-defined technical support area. Traders and active investors now have a bullish trade setting up in BAC stock.As I often discuss in this here column, when institutional investors - i.e. the investors that move the markets - allocate capital, they for the most part don't just buy one stock, but rather diversify among a theme, sector or industry group. To wit, Wednesday's rally in the financial stocks; both large-cap and small-cap banks lifted, as did insurance stocks, credit cards and more.Next, let's note that the financial sector currently makes up a little more than 14% of the entire S&P 500 and is the second largest sector of the index. The financials have shown some marginal lagging over the past few weeks/months and if they can now wake up then the broader market would get even more bullish sponsorship.More than anything, however, I am looking at this latest rally in financials as a group/sector rotation move and thus want to allocate some fresh trading capital there.Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 week, blue - 100 week, yellow - 50 weekOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that although BAC stock did ""correct"" and slip into a consolidation phase in early 2018, all in all it has held two key technical support areas: 1. its yellow 50-week simple moving average and 2. a simple diagonal support line as marked by the blue arrow.6 Elite Breakout Stocks and How You Can Spot Mega MovesFrom an intermediate to longer term perspective through the lens of technical analysis it is difficult to get structurally bearish this stock as long as it holds these simple support lines.Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 day, blue - 100 day, yellow - 50 dayOn the daily chart, we see the multimonth consolidation phase a little better. Note that BAC stock all along has held its red 200-day simple moving average as support. While one day does not make a trend, the broader financials rally on June 6 led BAC stock to rally off both horizontal support and the 200-day moving average to the tune of more than 3%.While upside here could quickly see the stock into the $31-$32 area as next targets, what I find notably more intriguing about this set up is the well-defined support area.

For example, Berkshire's $44,748 worth of Verizonstock would be a large investment for most people, but it represents just 0.00003% of Berkshire's portfolio and is therefore not a very significant ""Buffett stock.""With that in mind, there are 22 billion-dollar common stock positions in Berkshire's portfolio. In order from largest to smallest, here's a list of the billion-dollar ""Buffett stocks,"" and how you can use this data.CompanyShares Berkshire OwnsRecent Stock PriceValue of Berkshire's StakeKraft Heinz325,634,818$84.83$27.62 billionWells Fargo467,987,270$52.17$24.41 billionApple130,191,960$159.81$20.81 billionCoca-Cola400,000,000$45.62$18.24 billionAmerican Express151,610,700$85.12$12.91 billionInternational Business Machines54,084,673$134.15$7.60 billionPhillips 6680,689,892$82.31$6.64 billionU.S. Bancorp85,063,167$51.75$4.40 billionCharter Communications9,443,491$397.47$3.75 billionMoody's24,669,778$131.88$3.25 billionBank of New York Mellon50,229,588$52.68$2.67 billionSouthwest Airlines47,659,456$53.99$2.57 billionDelta Air Lines53,110,395$47.80$2.54 billionGoldman Sachs10,959,519$223.00$2.44 billionDaVita38,565,570$56.70$2.19 billionAmerican Airlines47,000,000$45.78$2.15 billionGeneral Motors60,000,000$35.12$2.11 billionLiberty SiriusXM45,951,345$43.50$2.00 billionUnited Continental Holdings28,211,563$64.94$1.83 billionVerisign12,952,745$99.73$1.29 billionVisa10,562,460$103.27$1.09 billionUSG Corporation39,002,016$26.57$1.04 billionData source: Berkshire Hathaway SEC filings. Positions as of 6/30/2017, while prices and values are current as of 8/22/2017.One of the main things to notice from this data is just how top-heavy the portfolio is. While Berkshire's portfolio consists of 46 stocks, including the 22 billion-dollar positions in the chart, more than 56% of the entire portfolio's value is concentrated in just four stocks -- Kraft Heinz, Wells Fargo, Apple, and Coca-Cola.Image source: The Motley Fool.Also notice that while there are 22 stocks in the chart, there are a couple of groups of similarly focused companies.Berkshire's airline stocksare perhaps the most obvious example from the chart. By themselves, none of Berkshire's airline investments are large, relative to some of the portfolio's largest holdings. However, notice that Berkshire has similarly sized investments in the four largest U.S. airlines -- American, Delta, United Continental, and Southwest -- worth more than $9 billion combined.Financials are another group well represented on the list. In addition to top Berkshire holdings Wells Fargo and American Express, you'll find three more banksand a major credit card processor among Berkshire's billion-dollar stocks. In all, banks and credit card processors make up just under $50 billion of Berkshire's stock portfolio.No discussion of Berkshire's billion-dollar stock positions would be complete without mentioning Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) .Thanks to a savvy financial crisis-era investment, Berkshire received warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank at a deeply discounted price. To make a long storyshort, Bank of America recently increased its quarterly dividend to a point where Buffett said he intended to exercise the warrants. However, Bank of America's capital plan was approved just days before the end of the second quarter, so the position has not been officially reported in Berkshire's SEC filings yet.Including Bank of America, Berkshire has 23 billion-dollar stock investments. And since 700 million shares of Bank of America are worth about $16.7 billion as of this writing, that means Berkshire's financial-sector stocks are worth nearly $67 billion altogether. In other words, it's fair to say that Berkshire's stock portfolio is highly dependent on the performance of the banking industry.I don't suggest buying or selling any stock simply because a billionaire has done the same -- even if that billionaire is named Warren Buffett. The more important lessons to learn are why Buffett likes each of these stocks and whether they fit your particular risk tolerance and investing goals. The bottom line is that while knowing what Warren Buffett owns can be a good starting point, it's still important to do your own research before buying any of the stocks on this list.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A shares) When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Past Due

by Peter Goodman (I got it from Simon, who I think got it for
free), and there on page 43 I ran into Eric Bochner. I thought
that name sounded familiar, and then I remembered what it was.
Eric Bochner was a vice president of something or other (and
then the vice president of something else or other) at Ariba,
where I worked from April 2000 until September 2001 (I was also
a consultant there from December 1999). Chapter 2 of Goodman's
book is about the Internet bubble, Ariba is his case study, and
Bochner is his source.As far as I know, no one has made Ariba the poster child for
the Internet bubble before-people usually go with WebVan, or
Pets.com, or something similarly vaporous. Ariba is a more
complicated story, but you can make a case that we deserve to
be on the poster. At our peak we were bigger than all those pet
food companies combined, with a market capitalization over $40
billion (on quarterly 
revenues

of about $100 million at that time). More to the point, if
Pets.com is comedy, Ariba is tragedy (well, not really, but you
know what I mean): Ariba was a real company with a real product
that got swept up in its own hype, with unfortunate
consequences (but not fatal ones-Ariba today earns over $300
million in annual revenues and a small profit).Goodman wants to make the case that there was no there
there, and Bochner says what he needs him to say.It was never about creating a business, he said. 'The
whole idea was attract investment, sell your story to the
Street, and then get yours out' (p. 47).But there was a there there, at least at the beginning.
Ariba's founders-mainly experienced veterans of other
successful technology companies, not twenty-somethings with no
clue-had a great idea (automating procurement by large
companies), and for the first few years almost everything went
well. (Ariba was founded in 1996 by seven people; Bochner
joined in October 1999, two months before I showed up as a
consultant.)The product really worked, it was better than anything out
there, the deals were huge, and most of the customers were
happy. Goodman says,there were obvious limitations to how much money Ariba
could make selling its software. It was aiming its product at
the big Fortune 500 companies. What happened when Ariba ran
out of customers? (pp. 44-45).But you can build an enormous company selling only to
Fortune 500 companies and their global equivalents (that's
where the money is, after all), and even during the frothy days
of the boom we sold almost exclusively to big companies
(because that's where the money is).In Goodman's account, Ariba was basically a fraud. In the
book, Bochner wasthe lead man in creating [the impression that Ariba was
constructing a global marketplace]. . . . From the beginning,
Bochner saw this as a rather impossible task,but he went through the motions anyway. Why? In Goodman's
words,the stock was the only thing that mattered. A valuable
stock gave Ariba currency it could use to buy other companies
(p. 46).As I recall, Ariba started out very much as a real company,
but was actually blindsided by the Internet boom. (
Update:

Note that I only joined Ariba in 2000, so my knowledge of the
early days is based on talking to many people who were there,
not actually being there.) In 1999, as industry and financial
analysts were talking up the business-to-business e-commerce
boom, they were looking for the leaders.The problem was that since business-to-business e-commerce
barely existed, there were no leaders. Ariba was the closest
thing they could find, at that was already a stretch (at the
time, Ariba's product did a good job of automating the process
of creating a purchase order, but most purchase orders were
automatically faxed to suppliers). Ariba had recently launched
the Ariba Network, which was a hub where suppliers could
publish electronic catalogs and buyers could route their
purchase orders to suppliers, and the analysts hungrily
anointed it the next big thing.There was nothing particularly wrong with the Ariba Network;
it did what we told the customers it did, more or less. The
problem was the hopes that were projected onto it by analysts
and, increasingly, by Ariba itself. Ariba's stock price kept
climbing and climbing, to the point where Ariba had to at least
try to deliver on the market's expectations; otherwise, its
stock would have collapsed and it would have been acquired. We
got into a vicious cycle where the more the stock climbed, the
more dependent we were on the story that was making it climb,
and the more ambitious and aggressive we had to be.We were by no means innocent victims. There was too much
watching the stock price, and a lot of believing our own
marketing. The jargon that Goodman makes fun of was terrible,
and I was responsible for some of it. More important, no one
put a gun to the CEO's head and said,you must try to build a global network of electronic
marketplaces and earn transaction fees by providing services
to all the participants in that marketplace.The management team could have said,This is silly. We're going to ignore the hype and focus on
what we do well, which is automating corporate procurement of
indirect goods(not direct manufacturing inputs). That's what we should
have done, even though it would have meant a collapse in the
stock price and being acquired. But the problem is we were
swept up in the hype like everyone else. It wasn't just the
analysts. The 
customers

all wanted to be building global electronic marketplace, and in
that group I include just about every large corporation in the
world; they were all talking to us and to our competitors
(Commerce One, Oracle, i2). They all wanted an e-commerce
strategy (because without one their stock prices were being
pounded) and 
we were their e-commerce strategy.

The customers came to us and said,We want this, everyone says you're the best, therefore
you're our best hope. And here's a big pile of money.And we did our best to build what they wanted. The problem
wasn't that the software was impossible to build; we could have
built it, although it would have taken a lot longer than anyone
wanted to wait. The problem was, as Bochner says, the degree of
industrial reorganization required was just not feasible in the
short timeframe. It was a business model problem: there was no
business model for, say, a single giant marketplace where small
business bought everything they needed from a universe of
suppliers, all hosted by Bank of America (

BAC

). Bank of America thought there was gold in that hill, and we
sold them a semi full of shovels.Back in early 2000, I think most of us thought it was
possible. Otherwise, it's hard to explain the energy, the
motivation, and the immense amount of work most of us did.
Goodman says on page 55,The tech start-ups and their Wall Street handlers
implicitly ridiculed the work ethic as an antiquated notion
while speaking to a different lobe of the American brain-the
part ruled by the frontier dream of finding a mountain of
gold and never working again.I beg to differ. Maybe the dream was to never work again,
but most people realized that to get there you had to work
very, very hard, and often at multiple startups. (There are
certainly examples of people who used connections to parachute
into startups just before they went public, but those people
are generally hated within the startup world.) Goodman is right
that the discount brokers like Ameritrade did create the
illusion that you could become rich by sitting in your pajamas
and trading stocks, but I don't think the image of Silicon
Valley ever included the idea of knocking off work at noon and
hitting the golf course (except maybe for venture capitalists).
If Ariba really had been a fraud, then the only people working
hard would have been in marketing, PR, and investor
relations.Over time, as with all bubbles, we began to doubt. By late
2000, I think most of us realized that reaching the
expectations the market had for us was a long shot. And as I
said, the fundamental problem wasn't the software, although the
software wasn't as good as it could have been. It was that the
customers were failing at building the marketplace communities
as fast as they had envisioned, and as the bubble imploded
suddenly they were no longer interested anymore, and suddenly
the market expected us to collapse. As it turned out, the
customers didn't really want what they had been desperately
scrambling for less than a year before. And we had over two
thousand people lined up to build shovels that no one
wanted.There are obviously parallels to the financial craze of
2004-2007, and we did more or less play the part of Chuck
Prince (music, dance, etc.). All of the paper wealth went to
the heads of people at the boom companies, who started thinking
they were smarter and better-looking than they actually were,
just like overpaid bankers are convinced they are actually
smarter than their college friends who got Ph.D.s in physics
and are now struggling junior professors. (Unlike the Wall
Street bubble, however, most of that wealth stayed on paper,
because of the rule that stock options vest over four years,
and the tendency for most people 
not

to cash out at the first opportunity.)But the big difference, as many have noted, is that ours was
an equity bubble, not (for the most part) a debt bubble.
Technology startups were funded by venture capital firms, which
generally have no debt, and by stock offerings; they generally
don't have the assets and steady cash flows to borrow money.
(The telecom infrastructure companies were an exception.) There
was little margin borrowing to buy stocks, as compared to the
1920s, so when the NASDAQ crashed, the damage did not spill
over into other asset classes, and the financial system didn't
even wobble.In Goodman's story, the tech bubble had a scarring effect on
the American psyche-two of them, actually. On the one hand, it
fueled the myth that you could get rich through investments
(buying tech stocks), which shifted household behavior away
from working and saving and toward living off of anticipated
capital gains. On the other hand, he says the collapse of the
tech bubble created a ""paralyzing state of cynicism"" (p. 81)
that hurt the economy for years afterward. Well, which one is
it?I think the simplest explanation is that people invested in
tech stocks because they wanted to get rich, and they got
burned; the real estate bubble is considerably more
complicated, because in many cases people 
had

to overpay for housing, because people have to buy houses (or
rent, but in many areas it's hard to find good rentals-that's a
whole other story), whereas no one 
had

to buy stock in WebVan.For those ex-Aribians wondering what happened to Eric
Bochner who don't want to buy the book, he's apparently now
running a chocolate factory in Iowa City, and he implies that
he didn't take much money off the table when he could (""The
money I had then, I wish I had now"" [p. 49]). I do know a few
people who took everything off the table that they could, but
only a very few. Most people lost their paper wealth along with
everyone else's paper wealth (and unlike Dick Fuld, they hadn't
sold hundreds of millions of dollars of stock on the way up).See also

If this were to happen, Berkshire would become the single largest shareholder in the banking giant, and after the recently released bank stress test results, it's highly likely to happen.Buffett insists that Berkshire Hathaway keep a minimum of $20 billion in cash at all times, and it often has a lot more than that. This allows Buffett to capitalize during tough economic times, or to ""be greedy when others are fearful,"" as he's said.Image Source: Getty Images.That is exactly what Buffett did in 2011 when he invested $5 billionof Berkshire's capital in Bank of America in the wake of the financial crisis. However, Buffett didn't simply buy Bank of America stock. Instead, he worked out a deal that turned out to be extremely lucrative.Buffett purchased $5 billion worth of preferred stock that paid a 6% annual dividend and, along with it, received warrants to purchase 700 million shares of Bank of America's common stock at any time before September 2021 for a price of just $7.14 per share.Notice that the exercise price of $7.14 times 700 million equals (roughly) $5 billion, the same as the value of Berkshire's preferred stock. This was very intentional. This essentially gives Buffett the ability to exchange Berkshire's preferred stock in a cashless exchange for 700 million shares of B of A.Bank of America shareholders are likely to be pleased with the outcome of the Federal Reserve Board's 2017 stress test and the approval of the bank's capital plan.Most significant for Buffett's purposes (more on that in a moment), Bank of America announced that it would increase its dividend by 60% to $0.12 per quarter ($0.48 annually), starting in the third quarter of 2017.Perhaps even more significant from a general shareholder's point of view, Bank of America also announced that its already-generous buyback programwould be more than doubled for 2017. The bank's board approved the repurchase of $12 billion in common stock during the period from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018, up from $5 billion on the current year's capital plan. This indicates that the bank's management still sees its stock as an attractive value.In recent years, Buffett had indicated that Berkshire would probably exercise its Bank of America warrants shortly before they expired in 2021.This year, however, Buffett modified this statement. Specifically, Buffett said, ""If the dividend rate on Bank of America common stock -- now 30 cents annually -- should rise above 44 cents before 2021, we would anticipate making a cashless exchange of our preferred into common.""Why did Buffett care about a $0.44 dividend threshold? Well, the preferred stock pays Berkshire 6% on $5 billion, or $300 million per year. On the other hand, if Berkshire owned the 700 million common shares for which it has warrants, a $0.44 dividend would translate to $308 million in annual dividend income.Since Bank of America is raising its annual dividend rate to $0.48, Berkshire can increase its income stream from its investment by $36 million per year by making the cashless exchange. Therefore, doing so is a no-brainer from Buffett's perspective.To be clear, I'm not saying Buffett is necessarily going to make the conversion immediately. However, I'd be surprised if it wasn't done before Bank of America's third-quarter ex-dividend date.To sum up what's happening, over a period of roughly six years, Buffett has turned an investment worth $5 billion that pays $300 million per year into one that's worth about $17 billion and pays $336 million. This translates to an annualized return of roughly 23% on the investment thus far, and if Buffett's shareholder letters are any indication, he may hang on to his Bank of America shares for years to come.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

That was the year that the nation's second-biggest bank by assets turned the cornerfrom the financial crisis. In the seven years before that, its earnings were erratic, sometimes dipping into negative territory. But since then, Bank of America has earned healthy and growing profits each quarter.The current fiscal year is a case in point. Over the first three quarters of 2017, Bank of America has earned an average of $5.2 billion a quarter. That marks a meaningful improvement over the previous year, when its average quarterly earnings came in at $4.5 billion. And at the rate Bank of America is going right now, 2018 will be even better. It's fair to think, in fact, that next year could be Bank of America's best year yet.Data source: YCharts.com. Chart by author.The first reason to think this is because the operating environment in the bank industry is improving. Interest rates are slowly but steadily inching higher, which will enable banks to earn more revenue from their portfolios of loans and interest-earning securities. To this end, over the past 12 months, the Federal Reserve has raised the fed funds ratethree times.At the same time, policymakers in Washington, D.C., are easing up on the regulatory environment, spurred by Donald Trump's vows on the campaign trail last year to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. This should lead to lower compliance costs at banks and more freedom to develop and experiment with new types of products and services without fear of a regulatory backlash.Earlier this week, the Senate Banking Committee announced that it had reached a bipartisan agreement to reduce the regulatory and compliance burden on banks with less than $100 billion in assets. And on Wednesday, the head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau announced that he will be stepping down, freeing the way for a more industry-friendly appointee to lead the agency.Image source: Getty Images.In addition to the improving operating environment, Bank of America has seen its performance improve across a variety of metrics.Its efficiency ratio serves as a case in point. This measures the percent of revenue that a bank spends on operating expenses, with a lower ratio being preferable to a higher ratio. Bank of America's goalhas been to get its efficiency ratio below 60%. Five years ago, that seemed like an impossible goal, but Bank of America has now not only gotten close to it, but the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank has dipped below the 60% threshold for two quarters in a row.It should be obvious that this is a good thing, as it means that more of Bank of America's revenue is free to fall to the bottom line, thereby bolstering shareholder value. Lest there by any doubt, however, you can see the impact of this on Bank of America's profitability.Profits and profitability are related, but they are not the same exact thing. Profits are how much a bank earns. Profitability then puts that into context based on a bank's size. This makes it easy to compare small banks to big banks in terms of how much value they generate for shareholders.In Bank of America's case, its goal has been to earn a 1% return on assets. If you take its annual net income, in other words, and divide that by the assets on its balance sheet, the quotient should be 1% or higher, which, not coincidentally, happens to be a standard industry benchmark.Bank of America came up short of this in the years after the 2008 crisis, as it absorbed an estimated $200 billionin crisis-related costs. But like its efficiency ratio, the bank has seen its profitability improve meaningfully, with 2015 similarly serving as an inflection point. Fast forward to the third quarter of this year, and Bank of America's return on assets came in at 0.98%, only two basis points below its target.Assuming that the economy doesn't head into a recession, which could cause loan losses to grow at banks and thereby weigh on earnings, it seems safe to assume that Bank of America will continue to make progress in terms of its earnings, efficiency, and profitability. It's for that reason that 2018 could end up being Bank of America's best year yet.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

If Trump's plan to lower the rate on corporations to 15% comes to fruition, Bank of America could redirect billions of dollars to dividends and share buybacks, both of which the North Carolina-based bank is inclined to do.Bank of America Tower (center) in New York City. Image source: Getty Images.According to my math, Bank of America's tax liability would be cut nearly in half under the White House's proposed plan. It would have shaved approximately $3.5 billion off its tax bill last year, which, holding all else equal, would have equated to a roughly 19% increase in Bank of America's bottom line.But as with most good things, there's a catch. Bank of America currently has $19 billion worth of net deferred tax assets sitting on its balance sheet. These stem from, among other things, past net operating losses the bank hasn't been able to claim yet, as well as tax credit carry-forwards that can be used to reduce its future tax liability.The catch is that the value of these assets is correlated to the corporate income-tax rate. If rates are lowered, so, too, will the value of Bank of America's deferred tax assets.Under a high tax rate, deferred tax assets are more valuable because there's more tax to offset. Because these assets expire after a set number of years, moreover, it's also possible that a lower tax rate would leave a portion of Bank of America's $19 billion net deferred tax assets unused. At a 15% rate, it wouldn't be able to claim the entire amount before the expiration date.Image source: Getty Images.Bank of America hasn't said how much a lower tax rate would affect the value of its deferred tax assets, noting in its latest 10-K:Policymakers have indicated an interest in reforming the U.S. corporate income tax code in 2017. Possible approaches include lowering the 35% corporate tax rate, modifying the U.S. taxation of income earned outside the U.S., and limiting or eliminating various deductions, tax credits, and/or other tax preferences. It is not possible at this time to quantify either the one-time impacts from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities that might result upon tax reform enactment or the ongoing impacts reform proposals might have on income tax expense.Bank of America's stance aside, estimates put the figure at $4.4 billion, which would presumably be realized by the $2.2 trillion bank over the course of a year.A write-down this big obviously makes a tax cut less attractive from Bank of America's perspective. Yet it would still be a boon to the bank, as it would shave billions of dollars off its annual tax liability on an ongoing basis.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Although Buffett and his team had until September 2021 to exercise the warrants, the Oracle of Omaha decided to pull the trigger and add Bank of America to Berkshire's portfolio four years early.According to a press release from Bank of America, Berkshire Hathaway has officially exercised its warrants to purchase 700 million shares of the bank, and it used the $5 billion in Bank of America preferred stock it already owned to do so.Image source: The Motley Fool.As would be expected, the bank's management seems to be happy to call Warren Buffett an investor. ""In 2011, we welcomed Berkshire Hathaway as a shareholder, and we appreciate their continued support now as our largest common shareholder,"" Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said in the press release.Bank of America's shareholders should be aware that although this will result in 700 million new shares being issued, their earnings will not be diluted. Berkshire's anticipated warrant exercise has already been included in the company's diluted EPS calculations.The simple answer is that exercising the warrants now made sense to Buffett from a cash-flow perspective.The original structure of Buffett's 2011 investmentin Bank of America was in two parts. Berkshire purchased $5 billion in Bank of America preferred stock, which had a 6% dividend generating $300 million in annual income. In addition, Berkshire also received warrants to buy 700 million shares of the bank at any time before September 2021 for just $7.14 per share. At the time, this was close to Bank of America's actual share price. Now, it's about one-third of what the bank's stock actually trades for.Notice that the $7.14 strike price times 700 million shares equals exactly$5 billion. This was done intentionally, and effectively allowed Buffett to simply exchange his preferred stock for 700 million shares of Bank of America.As long as the income from the preferred shares exceeded the dividends paid by 700 million shares of common stock, Buffett was happy to leave the arrangement alone. However, after passing this year's Federal Reserve stress tests, Bank of America increased its annualized dividendto $0.48 per share, which translates to $336 million in annual income. Given the dividend raise, it no longer makes sense to collect a lower stream of income from the preferred stock.Buffett seems to think that Bank of America is still an attractive long-term investment, despite the stock price roughly tripling since 2011. In an email to the Wall Street Journal, Buffett said that ""Berkshire is going to keep every share for a very long time.""In a previous letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett called the Bank of America investment ""one we value highly.""In addition, it's also worth noting that not only did Bank of America increase its dividend, but it more than doubled its buyback program to $12 billion for the period from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. This could be a sign that Bank of America's management still thinks the stock is an attractive value, even though the share price has become much higher than in recent years.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (A shares) When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

efficiency in banking business models has hit the global wealth
management industry. The good news is that there is $10 trillion in
high-net-worth bankable assets that haven't been tapped, according
to Scorpio Partnership's 2010 Global Private Banking study, which
was released Thursday.""Capturing these assets is the real answer for industry
recovery,"" the study, which tracked 230 wealth management
institutions, reported.The wealth management industry now has $16.5 trillion in assets
under management, up from $14.5 trillion in 2008. Yet Scorpio
reports that the real high-net-worth market opportunity is set at
$26 trillion, signaling that the global industry currently manages
63.5% of the real market.Profitability has dropped by a median of 35% from 2008,
according to the study. And cost/income ratios have risen to an
average 78.2%, up from 72.4% in 2008. In addition, net new money
data shows a median inflow across all institutions of $900 million
for the 2009, a decline of 60% from 2008.""The wealth management engine is still misfiring for many. On
the one hand the asset management machine is working and this is
shoring up numbers. While, for virtually all banks, in terms of
attracting new business it has been a case of Net No Money,"" said
Sebastian Dovey, managing partner, in a press release.
""Significantly, our global HNW data shows there are strong signs of
wealth creation even in these complex markets and yet new clients
are still holding back from opening accounts with the
industry.""Meanwhile, wealth is still concentrated among the top wealth
managers, with the top 10 now collectively managing $8.733 trillion

managed assets today.Bank of America [BAC] is still the top wealth manager,
followed by UBS. Despite its well-known tax scandals last year, UBS
was a strong performer compared to its peers and seems relatively
healthy, Scorpio reported. Morgan Stanley moved up four slots after
buying the Smith Barney business from Citibank, followed by Wells
Fargo, Credit Suisse, JP Morgan and Royal Bank of Canada, a new
entry on the list. To be in the top 20 ranking by assets under
management a private bank must now have over $135 billion of assets
under fee-based management.""The premier league of wealth managers have virtually all
benefited from strong asset management performance during the past
financial year with most in the top 20 posting double digit asset
growth,"" said Stephen Wall, director at Scorpio Partnership, in a
press release. ""Banks outside the top 100 are starting to show

Solomon is tasked with executing a plan to boost revenue by entering new businesses and refashioning old ones.Once considered the most savvy Wall Street trading house, it has suffered because of tougher regulation since the financial crisis of 2007-2009 and low market volatility crimping revenues.Goldman's quarterly profit topped analyst estimates, but equities trading was flat and higher fixed-income trading followed a notably weak year-ago period.Its shares, down 10.6 percent since the start of the year, were down 1.6 percent at midday.In a research note, Wells Fargo analysts attributed the decline to questions about the bank's shift in focus and noted Solomon's absence from the earnings call.Goldman Chief Financial Officer Martin Chavez told analysts on the call that Solomon's promotion was ""all part of the strategy.""""You'll see here the emphasis on more recurring fee-based revenue and you've seen that in the results. The emphasis on the growth plan, on driving revenue and earnings growth,"" he said.Chavez was also questioned on whether the bank was looking to improve disclosure and transparency for newer businesses.The bank gave some details on its new consumer lending business, Marcus, for which it has big ambitions, including a planned launch in Britain. Marcus' loan book currently totals just $3.1 billion compared with rival JP Morgan 's $400 billion consumer loan book.Chavez was asked why Marcus has yet to offer a banking app at a time when mobile banking is becoming the primary way customers transact.Analysts also asked why Goldman's compensation ratio had declined and for details on Goldman's investing and lending division and planned cash management push.Second-quarter profit rose 44 percent to $2.3 billion, or $5.98 per share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $3.95 per share. Analysts' average estimate was for $4.46 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts suggested investing and lending business and the bank setting aside less money for bonuses fueled the profit beat.Goldman said bond trading revenue climbed 45 percent from an unusually weak year-ago quarter.In equity trading, Goldman Sachs lagged rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Incand Bank of America Corp, all of which reported gains.Total revenue rose 19 percent to $9.4 billion, including increases in everything except fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions.The bank's compensation ratio, which measures dollars per revenue set aside for pay and benefits, declined to 39 percent from 41 percent in the prior and year-ago quarter.Writing by Sweta Singh and Lauren LaCapra","Stocks,Technology","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Eaton vance Floating-Rate Income Plus Fund (EFF) Ex-Dividend Date Scheduled for July 23, 2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/eaton-vance-floating-rate-income-plus-fund-eff-ex-dividend-date-scheduled-for-july-23-2018-cm993972', '_id': {'$oid': '5b51e1063efc2c0a6fb843ae'}}, {'news_title': 'Eaton Vance New York Municipal Bond Fund (ENX) Ex-Dividend Date Scheduled for July 23, 2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/eaton-vance-new-york-municipal-bond-fund-enx-ex-dividend-date-scheduled-for-july-23-2018-cm993973', '_id': {'$oid': '5b51e1063efc2c0a6fb843af'}}, {'news_title': 'Eaton Vance Enhanced Equity Income Fund II (EOS) Ex-Dividend Date Scheduled for July 23, 2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/eaton-vance-enhanced-equity-income-fund-ii-eos-ex-dividend-date-scheduled-for-july-23-2018-cm993974', '_id': {'$oid': '5b51e1063efc2c0a6fb843b0'}}]","{'$date': '2018-07-17T07:58:00Z'}"

Earningsbeat expectations, loans and deposits grew nicely, and Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathawaybecame the bank's biggest investor. However, 2018 could be even stronger. Here's what I expect from Bank of America in 2018 and what it means to you as an investor.Bank of America has become a much more efficient bank since the financial crisis, and a big reason for this is its investment in mobile and online technologies. Simply put, it costs a bank much less for a customer to complete a transaction through a mobile app or an online banking portal than it does in a branch.Image source: Bank of America. http://newsroom.bankofamerica.com/press-kits/bank-america-corporate-materialsOver the past few years, the bank has been reducing its physical footprint, closing about 8% of its branches. Meanwhile, the reliance on mobile and digital banking has increased dramatically -- 23% of the bank's deposits now occur through its mobile app, up from just 12% at the end of 2014. There are now 4.7 million more digital banking users and 7.7 million more mobile banking users than there were three years ago.The bank's online and mobile platforms are also some of the best in the industry. Javelin and Forrester named Bank of America No. 1 in mobile banking and digital sales functionality, respectively, and Kiplinger'snamed the bank's Merrill Edge platform the No. 1online brokerfor 2017.In 2018, I expect a continued emphasis on technology and increased adoption of the bank's mobile services, which should help to improve efficiency even further.Bank of America, like most other U.S big banks, took a big one-time chargein the fourth quarter, after tax reform effectively devalued the deferred tax asset on its balance sheet.However, over the long run, the new lower corporate tax rate should provide a major boost to profitability. In fact, CFO Paul Donofrio said that the bank's effective tax rate should drop to 20% for 2018.Over the past few years, Bank of America has operated at an effective tax rate of roughly 29%, so this could translate to serious savings. Just to give you an idea, consider that for 2017, its pre-tax profit was $29.2 billion -- 9% of this amount is $2.6 billion. So even if Bank of America doesn't grow its pre-tax income at all (unlikely), it will see its net income increase by billions of dollars in 2018.Speaking of growing its income, one catalyst that could make it happen in 2018 is margin expansion.While it's not a completely predictable relationship, a general rule of thumb is that when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the rates that banks charge on loans tend to grow faster than the rates they pay out on deposits. The result is that the spread between the two, or the bank's interest margin, tends to increase.The Fed increased rates three times in 2017, by a quarter-percentage point each time. And over the past year, Bank of America's net interest yield has gone from 2.23% to 2.39%, a 13-basis-point increase. Sure, a difference of 0.13% doesn't sound like much, but when we're talking about a loan portfolio of more than $900 billion, this makes a big difference.With the Fed projected to raise rates at least three times in 2018, we could see a similar trend unfold.This is perhaps the boldest prediction I'm going to make here. Banks generally need to generate at least a 10% return on equity to cover their cost of capital, so this figure, along with a 1% return on assets, are widely considered to be industry benchmarks. Bank of America also hasn't achieved them since before the financial crisis.However, it's been getting close. The fourth quarter of 2017 is a bad indicator due to the one-time issues, but during the third quarter, its 7.9% ROE and 0.95% ROA weren't too far off. Plus, there has been tremendous improvement:Time PeriodReturn on EquityReturn on AssetsFull-year 20110%0.06%Full-year 20121.3%0.19%Full-year 20134.6%0.53%Full-year 20141.7%0.23%Full-year 20156.2%0.73%Full-year 20166.7%0.82%Q3 20177.9%0.95%Data source: Bank of America company financials.With the bank's improving efficiency and asset quality, lower legal expenses, and the positive catalysts of tax reform and interest rate expansion, I think that 2018 could be the year that Bank of America finally breaks through the ROE and ROA barriers.Bank of America's book value dropped in 2017. It wasn't for a bad reason -- it fell during the third quarter because Warren Buffett exercised warrantsto buy 700 million shares of the bank for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, which had a dilutive effect (as expected) on the stock, and it also dropped slightly during the fourth quarter due to one-time charges.In 2018, I see no reason why Bank of America's book value per share won't climb significantly from its current level, especially if profitability improves and loan and deposit growth continue.The bottom line is that I expect Bank of America to have a strong year in 2018. Although the stock has been one of the best performers in the sector, if the predictions outlined here prove to be accurate, the stock could certainly have more room to the upside.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The stock has risen by more than 38% over the past year and is up a staggering 163% since its February 2016 lows, handily beating the performance of the S&P 500 and the overall financial sector.After such a remarkable run, it's only natural to wonder whether Bank of America's stock could be getting a bit expensive. However, there's a solid case to be made that the gains are well justified, and the bank's management recently announced a move that indicates that they still think the stock is cheap. After an already-massive buyback announcement earlier this year, Bank of America is planning to spend billions more to buy back its own stock.Image source: Bank of America.Bank of America's stock has soared, but that doesn't mean that it's necessarily expensive. In fact, I would argue the exact opposite.For starters, there have been several industrywide catalysts that have caused bank stocks as a group to be among the top performers in the market. The Federal Reserve has started to raise interest rates, and is widely expected to continue doing so. This has resulted in expanded profit margins for banks, and could lead to billions in additional profit over the next few years if rates continue to climb.In addition, the banking industry could be one of the biggest beneficiaries of a lower corporate tax rate, and of looser banking regulations. Some expectation of this is certainly priced into the stock at this point, but these could still be positive catalysts once they're official.Finally, Bank of America has been one of the most impressive turnaround storiesin the post-financial-crisis banking industry. The bank's income continues to rise, asset quality continues to improve, and the company has done an excellent job of cutting expenses, embracing new banking technologies, and running a much more efficient operation.Bank of America already had implemented one of the largest buyback plansin the industry earlier this year. The bank had announced that as part of its approved capital plan, it would repurchase $12 billion worth of its common stock between July 1, 2017, and June 30, 2018. This is more than double the previous year's buyback authorization, and came in addition to a big dividend increase, and is in addition to the $0.9 billion in repurchases the company plans to make to offset its equity-based compensation during that period.Recently, the bank announced that it was increasing its buyback by an additional $5 billion, meaning that Bank of America plans to buy back a total of $17 billion in stock by June 30, 2018.This increase has already been approved by the Federal Reserve, and is a result of the increased amount of capital the bank has after Berkshire Hathawayexercised its warrants and became the bank's largest shareholder, as well as from the sale of its non-U.S. credit card business earlier in 2017.Generally, a company buys back stock when it feels that it is the most compelling way to return capital to shareholders. Bank of America's management has said that it feels its stock is an attractive long-term value, even at 2017's higher share prices, and that it plans to emphasize buybacks for the foreseeable future. With this latest move, the bank's management is putting its money where its mouth is.To give you an idea of just how big Bank of America's buyback program is, consider that the one-year buyback authorization of $17 billion is enough to repurchase nearly 6% of the bank's outstanding shares, even at the current share price, which is a nine-year high for the bank. In fact, it's just about $3 billion short of negating the dilutive effects of Berkshire Hathaway's massive common stock purchase entirely.In a nutshell, Bank of America's choice to use its excess capital to buy back even more stock sends a clear message to investors that the bank's management doesn't consider the stock to be expensive yet.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Should Investors Be Happy?","{'$date': '2017-12-28T07:02:00Z'}","By Matthew Frankel, Motley Fool","https://www.nasdaq.com/author/fool","When it comes to returning capital to shareholders, Bank of America's (NYSE: BAC) dividend tends to get the most attention. This is especially true after 2017's massive dividend increase that prompted Warren Buffett to finally exercise Berkshire Hathaway's warrants to buy 700 million shares of Bank of America's common stock.However, dividends are a surprisingly small part of the bank's capital return strategy. The majority of Bank of America's capital return is in the form of share repurchases. In fact, the bank spent nearly $8 billion on buybacks through the first three quarters, and there's reason to believe that this number will swell when the year-end results are released.Image source: Bank of America.Through the first three quarters of 2017, Bank of America returned $10.7 billion to its shareholders, and as I mentioned, most of this came in the form of share repurchases. In fact, the bank spent $7.9 billion of this amount on its buybacks.At first glance, the math may not make it look like Bank of America has repurchased any shares at all. There were 10.05 billion shares outstanding at the beginning of the year and 10.46 billion at the end of the third quarter. However, remember that 700 million new shareswere issued to Berkshire Hathaway, so by subtracting these, you see that there are 290 million fewer shares outstanding now, excluding the effect of Berkshire.Bank of America has really accelerated its buyback program in recent years. The bank expects to return $14.2 billion to shareholders in 2017, with most of this amount coming from buybacks. In 2016, the bank returned less than half of this amount.And this may actually be a conservative estimate. In fact, since the bank revealed this estimate, management has announced that $5 billion is being added to the current buybackauthorization, which runs from July 1, 2017, through June 30, 2018. The bank previously planned to buy back $12 billion in stock during that time period, so this translates to a 42% increase.To be fair, the reasons for Bank of America's emphasis on buybacks don't all have to do with management believing the stock is cheap.As I discussed in a recent podcast, another advantage to buybacks (from a company's standpoint) is that they're much more flexible than dividends. In other words, if it cuts its dividend, it generally results in a wave of negative headlines and speculation that the company must be struggling. Meanwhile, if it reduces its buyback rate, few shareholders would even notice.Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan has specifically said that the company will continue to favor buybacks over dividend increases for this very reason. Investor perception of Bank of America's financial health is just starting to become positive, and a forced dividend reduction could be a disaster. On the other hand, the bank could easily decide to buy back fewer shares next year without much repercussion.Having said that, management has said that it also believes its shares are a good value, and largest shareholder Warren Buffett has voiced his agreement. Moynihan has said that ""our stock's a good buy and we'll continue to buy it until the cows come home."" And Buffett, who famously advocates holding stocks for long periods of time, has saidthat ""We (Berkshire) will be holders of BofA stock for a long, long, long time.""So, as a Bank of America shareholder myself, I'm happy that the bank is aggressively buying back shares and intends to continue doing so for the foreseeable future.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

However, the bank's revenue slightly missed, at $21.4 billion versus expectations of $21.531 billion.That said, there's a lot more to the story than just the headline numbers, and this is especially true for Bank of America. Here are eight things that investors should know in order to effectively interpret Bank of America's most recent results.Image source: Bank of America.The bank's solid results were fueled by a nice increase in deposits and loans. The bank's deposit base grew by 3% year over year, including impressive 8% growth in consumer deposits. Bank of America's consumer deposits should allow it to benefit from rising interest rates more than most, as their cost (interest paid) on consumer deposits is just 0.04% -- practically nothing.Even though mortgage and home equity loans declined by about 20%, the overall loan portfolio grew by 2% on particularly strong growth in consumer lending, such as credit cards and auto loans.Thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the bank took a one-time $2.9 billion charge in the fourth quarter. I explained why most banks initially took a hitin a recent article, but in a nutshell, Bank of America and most of its peers carry deferred tax assets on its balance sheet, which immediately became less valuable when the corporate tax rate fell.However, it's important to emphasize that this was a one-timeexpense, and the long-term benefits are likely to outweigh the bad. Bank of America generally operates at an effective tax ratio greater than 30%, so the new 21% corporate tax rate could boost earnings for years to come.Even if you exclude the impact of tax reform, Bank of America's fourth-quarter return on assets (ROA) and return on equity (ROE) of 0.90% and 7.8%, respectively, might seem a bit of a step backwards. However, there's one other one-time item that weighed down profits.In addition to the tax reform impact, there's one more thing that skewed Bank of America's results for the quarter -- a ""single-name non-U.S. charge-off"" of about $300 million, which made up the bulk of the $327 million increase in net charge-offs for the quarter.As expected, Bank of America's net interest yield (its profit margin on loans) grew during the fourth quarter and for the full year. Generally speaking, when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, it results in larger spreads for banks between the interest rates they pay on deposits and the interest rates they charge on loans. Over the past year, Bank of America's NIM has increased by 16 basis points, and its net interest income for the fourth quarter was $1.2 billion higher than a year ago.One weak spot among banks engaged in investment banking activities was fixed income trading, and Bank of America was no exception. The bank's fixed-income trading revenue dropped by 13% in the fourth quarter.However, this is surprisingly good news. Not only did it beat the bank's own expectation for a 15% drop, but it handily beat peers. JPMorgan Chasereported a 34% drop in fixed-income trading revenue, and Goldman Sachs' dropped by 50%. In comparison, 13% doesn't look to bad at all.In addition to improving asset quality and boosting capital levels, expense control has been one of Bank of America's main priorities over the past several years. The bank's noninterest expense dropped by 1% year over year, but this includesthe roughly $200 million in year-end bonuses and charitable giving the bank decided to do after the tax reform bill passed.You may not think of Bank of America as a technology leader, but that's exactly what it has become. The bank has invested aggressively in new, efficiency-improving technologies over the past few years, and the results have been impressive.Over the past year alone, the number of active digital banking users has risen by 12%, and the bank's mobile channel has received 33% more logins. Twenty-three percent of the bank's deposits are now mobile, and since Zelle was integrated into the bank's app last year, the bank's person-to-person payment volume has more than doubled.Just to name a few of the accolades the bank has received, Bank of America was named No. 1 in mobile banking by Javelin, No. 1 in digital sales functionality by Forrester, and its Merrill Edge brokerage platform was named the No. 1online brokerby Kiplinger's.You may have noticed that several data points in Bank of America's earnings have stories behind them that show why they're not as bad as they seem, such as the tax-cut charge and the higher charge-off rate. Another example is the bank's book value.You may notice that Bank of America's book value per share has fallen over the past year, from $23.97 to $23.80. While this may sound alarming, the main reason for this is that there are more shares outstanding than there were a year ago, thanks to Warren Buffett's massive 700 million share investment. Excluding the dilutive effects of these shares, the bank's book value would have increased by about 4% for the year.Overall, Bank of America had a strong fourth quarter, despite what the tax-cut charge and increased charge-off rate might have you believe. Not only did the bank post strong 2017 performance, but it's well-positioned to capitalize on tax reform and rising interest rates going forward.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Solomon is tasked with executing a plan to boost revenue by entering new businesses and refashioning old ones.Once considered the most savvy Wall Street trading house, it has suffered because of tougher regulation since the financial crisis of 2007-2009 and low market volatility crimping revenues.Goldman's quarterly profit topped analyst estimates, but equities trading was flat and higher fixed-income trading followed a notably weak year-ago period.Its shares, down 10.6 percent since the start of the year, were down 1.6 percent at midday.In a research note, Wells Fargo analysts attributed the decline to questions about the bank's shift in focus and noted Solomon's absence from the earnings call.Goldman Chief Financial Officer Martin Chavez told analysts on the call that Solomon's promotion was ""all part of the strategy.""""You'll see here the emphasis on more recurring fee-based revenue and you've seen that in the results. The emphasis on the growth plan, on driving revenue and earnings growth,"" he said.Chavez was also questioned on whether the bank was looking to improve disclosure and transparency for newer businesses.The bank gave some details on its new consumer lending business, Marcus, for which it has big ambitions, including a planned launch in Britain. Marcus' loan book currently totals just $3.1 billion compared with rival JP Morgan 's $400 billion consumer loan book.Chavez was asked why Marcus has yet to offer a banking app at a time when mobile banking is becoming the primary way customers transact.Analysts also asked why Goldman's compensation ratio had declined and for details on Goldman's investing and lending division and planned cash management push.Second-quarter profit rose 44 percent to $2.3 billion, or $5.98 per share, compared with $1.6 billion, or $3.95 per share. Analysts' average estimate was for $4.46 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Analysts suggested investing and lending business and the bank setting aside less money for bonuses fueled the profit beat.Goldman said bond trading revenue climbed 45 percent from an unusually weak year-ago quarter.In equity trading, Goldman Sachs lagged rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Incand Bank of America Corp, all of which reported gains.Total revenue rose 19 percent to $9.4 billion, including increases in everything except fees from advising on mergers and acquisitions.The bank's compensation ratio, which measures dollars per revenue set aside for pay and benefits, declined to 39 percent from 41 percent in the prior and year-ago quarter.Writing by Sweta Singh and Lauren LaCapra","FundamentalAnalysis,WorldMarkets,Stocks,Technology,Earnings","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Retail Opportunity Investments Corp.

A failure to meet the requirement would normally result in an outright failure.""Ten years on, it's time to take a fresh look,"" he said. ""We don't want to be chasing in the last crisis, we're trying to figure out the next one.""Officials Gorman has spoken with at the Fed have sympathy with his argument that rules about banks' capital ratios should be reexamined, he said.Appearing before Congress on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was questioned extensively on the central bank's approach to this year's stress tests, with Democrats criticizing the Fed for passing Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inceven though their capital levels fell below the minimum required.Powell told lawmakers that there had been no ""haggling"" or negotiations with Morgan Stanley over its stress tests results and capital plan, and added that the Fed was committed to the stress testing process. ""It's a very important thing for us and we'll make sure to keep it stringent.""The Fed purposefully increased the stringency of the stress test this year because firms are more likely to take on greater risk as the broader economic environment improves.Gorman said that he does not expect Morgan Stanley will need to cut its capital distribution program going forward as a result of the tests.The 60-year-old CEO has restored Morgan Stanley to health since taking over in 2010, when the bank was still reeling from the financial crisis. His tenure has been defined by reducing risk, exiting problematic businesses and focusing on steadier ones that can generate reliable revenue.The bank's second-quarter profit jumped 39 percent, to $2.4 billion, or $1.30 per share, from $1.8 billion, or 87 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Adjusted for special items, its profit was $1.25 per share, topping the $1.11 per share analysts expected, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Morgan Stanley benefited from higher revenues in trading, investment banking and wealth management.Volatility caused by escalating trade tensions and central bank policy changes stirred an increase in trading volumes across Wall Street. However, Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan warned that a seasonal slowdown and geopolitical concerns could weigh on activity moving forward.Morgan Stanley shares were up 3.6 percent in mid-morning trading. Its chief rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, reported a 44-percent jump in quarterly profits, also driven by trading gains and officially named David Solomon as successor to CEO Lloyd Blankfein.Goldman is undergoing a strategic overhaul to generate more revenue by focusing steadier businesses, generating comparisons to the strategy Gorman laid out many years ago.Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Coand Bank of America Corpare also pursuing new initiatives involving digital banks or branch networks to expand their presence with U.S. consumers.Asked by Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo whether Morgan Stanley might need to do something similar to keep up with competitors, Gorman said his bank had made more changes in the past eight years than in the previous 80 and had no plans to change course.""I think it is unwise to run strategy through envy,"" he said.GRAPHIC-Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs earningsWriting by Meredith Mazzilli","WorldMarkets,Stocks","BAC","[{'news_title': 'European Stocks Rebound as Aviation Stocks, Oil Futures Prices Edge Higher', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/european-stocks-rebound-as-aviation-stocks-oil-futures-prices-edge-higher-cm1021272', '_id': {'$oid': '5b98e0f1c6a7228a63b33ed3'}}, {'news_title': 'Farmer Brothers (FARM) Q4 2018 Earnings Conference Call Transcript', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/farmer-brothers-farm-q4-2018-earnings-conference-call-transcript-cm1021269', '_id': {'$oid': '5b98e0f1c6a7228a63b33ed4'}}, {'news_title': 'No Good Deed Goes Unpunished for Social-Media Giants', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/no-good-deed-goes-unpunished-for-social-media-giants-cm1021270', '_id': {'$oid': '5b98e0f1c6a7228a63b33ed5'}}]","{'$date': '2018-07-18T07:25:00Z'}"

But executives now plan two further hubs to service customers across the European Union, the source told Reuters. One is likely to be in Frankfurt and the location of the second is yet to be confirmed, the person said.They are part of a wider trend that is seeing lenders distribute their post-Brexit resources among a number of cities on the continent rather than basing the bulk of operations in one place as they have for decades in London.Swiss bank UBSsaid in March it would pursue a ""decentralized"" model, in line with moves by Goldman Sachs, Bank of Americaand JPMorgan.Such plans will incur greater costs and complexity, as each subsidiary needs to be capitalised and licensed by regulators. They run counter to the expectations among many executives and analysts, following Britain's 2016 vote to leave the EU, that banks would each choose one main continental hub to replace London, with Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin the frontrunners.A spokesman for Lloyds declined to comment.Earlier this year, separate sources told Reuters that Lloyds would house its main European subsidiary in Berlin, after converting an existing Bank of Scotland branch that Lloyds inherited following the HBOS takeover a decade ago.SINGLE MARKETThe plan to run three continental units has partly been prompted by new British regulations that have already forced UK banks to carve up balance sheets into individually capitalised ""ringfenced"" and ""non-ringfenced"" entities ahead of a January 2019 deadline.The rules are aimed at insulating bank depositors from riskier trading activities and protecting taxpayers from having to backstop troubled banks once deemed ""too big to fail"".To comply with the rules following Brexit, Lloyds needs a second subsidiary to support its non-ringfenced euro bond trading business, the source said.That subsidiary is likely to be set up in Frankfurt, the source said, which is home to Europe's biggest euro bond trading market outside London and offers the bank the best chance of running a smooth service to clients following Britain's expected exit from the EU single market on March 29 next year.The Frankfurt subsidiary will not need a full banking licence but Lloyds has applied to Germany's financial markets regulator for the requisite investment firm licence, the source added.Lloyds is also seeking to establish a third subsidiary in an as yet unconfirmed location to support its Scottish Widows ""closed-book"" insurance business, which include premium-paying policies from customers based across the European Union.All three subsidiaries will need to be capitalised individually, the source said, but the total pool of capital needed is not expected to be large compared with the size of the group's overall balance sheet.Earlier this year, Reuters reported the ultimate size of the pool of capital carved out to capitalise the Berlin subsidiary was expected to run to the ""low hundreds of millions of pounds"", representing less than 1 percent of the bank's overall capital.Lloyds already employs around 300 people in Berlin, including a full management team, finance, risk and human resources staff. It expects to shift no more than a handful of staff from Britain to complement the existing workforce, the source said.","Stocks,Politics","BAC","[{'news_title': ""Apple's (AAPL) iPhone Launch Event: What To Expect"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/apples-aapl-iphone-launch-event-what-to-expect-cm1021623', '_id': {'$oid': '5b992264c6a722544a85b1f5'}}, {'news_title': 'TSX May Open Lower As Trade Worries Worsen', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tsx-may-open-lower-as-trade-worries-worsen-cm1021634', '_id': {'$oid': '5b992264c6a722544a85b1f6'}}, {'news_title': ""3 Things You Don't Know About Marijuana Stock Tilray"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-things-you-dont-know-about-marijuana-stock-tilray-cm1021630', '_id': {'$oid': '5b992264c6a722544a85b1f7'}}]","{'$date': '2018-07-18T03:03:00Z'}"

consideration for the top job at 
Bank of America

(

BAC

) have called on the board to consider breaking up the bank. They
are having none of it. As a result, the CEO search for Ken Lewis'
replacement continues.All in all, you would have to give the board of Bank of America
an ""F"" for how they've monitored management and succession planning
since a firestorm enveloped the company last Fall.Primarily blame for the lack of preparedness the board has shown
to having a successor for Ken Lewis waiting in the wings lies at
the feet of Hugh McColl, Lewis' predecessor. McColl has really
shaped what Bank of America has grown into. It won't change until
he leaves.On a ""Frontline"" episode from last year describing the financial
meltdown, McColl, who is still the bank's chairman, recounted how
he'd masterminded turning the small NCNB National Bank of North
Carolina into the Bank of America juggernaut. He said that, as a
company, ""you're either growing or you're dying.""He took that advice to heart and did a series of acquisitions of
companies to create a national titan in banking. And that's why
it's unlikely this bank will break itself up now or while McColl is
still around. It's just not in their corporate DNA.Bank of America is the house that Hugh built. He hand-picked his
board to be his lapdogs. He hand-picked his successor, Lewis, to
carry on exactly in the fashion he had led the bank.Lewis didn't miss a beat. In fact, he took it up a notch, making
increasingly bigger acquisitions. Lewis' tenure as CEO will be
defined by his acquisitions of MBNA, Fleet Bank, Countrywide, and
Merrill Lynch. The bank is now enormous.Yet, Lewis didn't like how he was treated by the government and
the press. He was used to being seen as Ken the Conqueror, not a
lightning rod for criticism. So, he decided to take his ball and go
home. His decision to quit after the summer left the board
completely flat-footed.Succession planning is only something a company is judged on
when they do it badly. The fact that Bank of America is now having
such a hard time filling the top spot signals how poorly equipped
this board was to do scenario planning.It's a pretty basic question that every board must always think
about: what would we do tomorrow if the CEO got hit by a bus? Most
of the time, there are two to three internal candidates' names
which easily come to mind. Nine times out of 10, a board would
rather select an internal candidate for the knowledge of the
company, industry, customers, and employees who will be able to
take the company forward.All of the largest banks in America appear to have done a poor
job of internal talent development, but Bank of America is by far
the worst. Why?At the end of the day, the bank's directors were charter members
of the ""Friends of Hugh"" club. Their primary job as a director was
to rubber-stamp whatever Hugh wanted to do. If Hugh didn't bring up
the issue of succession planning, it didn't need to be
considered.That's why, starting after the Spring shareholders' meeting (at
which there were several directors who received large numbers of
""against"" votes), the Federal Reserve has started reassembling the
board of directors. That's something 
we first started mentioning here

over the summer.This revamped board was still not able to get an effective
succession process in place to prepare for Lewis' surprise
departure. They should entertain all kinds of scenarios such as
breaking up the bank. In my view, it epitomizes a ""too-big-to-fail""
financial institution and hasn't demonstrated that it can manage
the disparity and scope of so many businesses.If the Fed really wants to see the company change, though, it
should remove all directors who have ties to Hugh McColl. Once that
happens, this board will start to rethink how this bank should be
run from a truly fresh perspective. And they'll probably conclude
it does need to be broken up.This article originally appeared on TheStreet.comSee also

The Buffett-led conglomerate owns 700 million shares of the banking giant. Let's look at the percentage of Bank of America that Buffett owns, and review how the Oracle of Omaha came to be Bank of America's biggest investor.As I mentioned, Berkshire Hathaway recently acquired 700 million shares in Bank of America. At the end of 2017's second quarter, there were a total of 9.88 billion shares outstanding, which makes Buffett's stake roughly 7% of the total.Image Source: The Motley Fool.The story of how Berkshire Hathaway came to be Bank of America's largest shareholder is quite different than how the company invested in most of the rest of its stock portfolio. In other words, it didn't simply buy shares of the bank and build up a position.In the wake of the financial crisis in 2011, Buffett decided to invest$5 billion of Berkshire's capital in Bank of America's preferred stock, which paid Berkshire a 6% annual dividend yield. As you may be thinking, generally speaking, a 6% return on investment isn't enough to get Buffett excited.However, the deal had a sweetener. In addition to preferred stock, Buffett received warrants to purchase 700 million shares of Bank of America at any time before September 2021 at an exercise price of just $7.14 -- which was close to the actual share price of Bank of America stock at the time the deal was made.The key point of the deal is that 700 million times the $7.14 exercise price is equal to $5 billion -- the value of the preferred stock Buffett purchased. This essentially meant that Buffett could exchange the preferred stock for 700 shares of common stock.Well, Buffett decided to exercise his warrants shortly after the bank's 2017 capital plan was approved. At that point, Bank of America was trading for more than three timesBuffett's exercise price.Despite the gains in Bank of America's stock price over the past few years that led to Buffett's big windfall, there's still reason to believe that Bank of America is an attractive long-term investment at the current price.For starters, if Warren Buffett didn't think that Bank of America was undervalued, he likely wouldn't have exercised his warrants -- at least not yet. The main reasonBuffett chose to exercise Berkshire's warrants more than four years before expiration was Bank of America's most recent dividend increase, as I mentioned, but dividend or not, Buffett is not in the business of owning stocks that he doesn't consider to be attractively valued.Bank of America's management seems to agree. Along with the dividend increase, Bank of America announced that its board has approved the repurchase of up to $12 billion of its common stock during the one-year period from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018. This is more than twice the amount of the previous buyback authorization, and makes up more than 70% of the bank's planned return of capital to shareholders. In other words, Bank of America is still emphasizing buybacks, which is a good indication that management likes the value.In full disclosure, Bank of America is one of my largest stock positions, but it's precisely because I feel that its price is attractive. Buffett and the bank's management team both seem to agree with me.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

A failure to meet the requirement would normally result in an outright failure.""Ten years on, it's time to take a fresh look,"" he said. ""We don't want to be chasing in the last crisis, we're trying to figure out the next one.""Officials Gorman has spoken with at the Fed have sympathy with his argument that rules about banks' capital ratios should be reexamined, he said.Appearing before Congress on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was questioned extensively on the central bank's approach to this year's stress tests, with Democrats criticizing the Fed for passing Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inceven though their capital levels fell below the minimum required.Powell told lawmakers that there had been no ""haggling"" or negotiations with Morgan Stanley over its stress tests results and capital plan, and added that the Fed was committed to the stress testing process. ""It's a very important thing for us and we'll make sure to keep it stringent.""The Fed purposefully increased the stringency of the stress test this year because firms are more likely to take on greater risk as the broader economic environment improves.Gorman said that he does not expect Morgan Stanley will need to cut its capital distribution program going forward as a result of the tests.The 60-year-old CEO has restored Morgan Stanley to health since taking over in 2010, when the bank was still reeling from the financial crisis. His tenure has been defined by reducing risk, exiting problematic businesses and focusing on steadier ones that can generate reliable revenue.The bank's second-quarter profit jumped 39 percent, to $2.4 billion, or $1.30 per share, from $1.8 billion, or 87 cents per share, in the year-ago period.Adjusted for special items, its profit was $1.25 per share, topping the $1.11 per share analysts expected, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Morgan Stanley benefited from higher revenues in trading, investment banking and wealth management.Volatility caused by escalating trade tensions and central bank policy changes stirred an increase in trading volumes across Wall Street. However, Morgan Stanley Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan warned that a seasonal slowdown and geopolitical concerns could weigh on activity moving forward.Morgan Stanley shares were up 3.6 percent in mid-morning trading. Its chief rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, reported a 44-percent jump in quarterly profits, also driven by trading gains and officially named David Solomon as successor to CEO Lloyd Blankfein.Goldman is undergoing a strategic overhaul to generate more revenue by focusing steadier businesses, generating comparisons to the strategy Gorman laid out many years ago.Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Coand Bank of America Corpare also pursuing new initiatives involving digital banks or branch networks to expand their presence with U.S. consumers.Asked by Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo whether Morgan Stanley might need to do something similar to keep up with competitors, Gorman said his bank had made more changes in the past eight years than in the previous 80 and had no plans to change course.""I think it is unwise to run strategy through envy,"" he said.GRAPHIC-Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs earningsWriting by Meredith Mazzilli","WorldMarkets,Stocks,Economy","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 9/13/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-peter-lynch-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-9132018-cm1022134', '_id': {'$oid': '5b9a274cc6a7224480748ba2'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Motley Fool Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 9/13/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-motley-fool-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-9132018-cm1022133', '_id': {'$oid': '5b9a274cc6a7224480748ba3'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Martin Zweig Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 9/13/2018', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-martin-zweig-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-9132018-cm1022132', '_id': {'$oid': '5b9a274cc6a7224480748ba4'}}]","{'$date': '2018-07-18T07:25:00Z'}"

Specifically, here are seven pieces of information from the presentation that investors may be pleasantly surprised to learn.Although it's not the biggest U.S. bank by assets -- JPMorgan Chasecurrently has that title -- Bank of America is the largest bank in terms of U.S. retail deposit market share. In addition, Bank of America is the top home equity lender, has the most personal trust assets under management, and has the largest U.S. wealth-management market share across client assets, deposits, and loans, just to name a few.Image Source: Getty Images. (Note: Image does not depict a Bank of America facility.)Generally speaking, diversification in a company's revenue stream is a positive factor, as it can mitigate the risk related to any specific area of the business. Bank of America operates its business in four segments -- consumer banking, global wealth and investment management, global banking, and global markets -- none of which account for more than 38% of the company's revenue.SegmentPercentage of Revenue (First half of 2017)Consumer banking38%Global banking22%Global wealth and investment management21%Global markets19%Data Source: Bank of America presentation.Here's an example of how this can help. If trading revenue is a weak spot in the banking industry, as it is right now, banks that rely heavily on it, such as Goldman Sachs, take a major hit. In Bank of America's case, trading revenue makes up a relatively small amount of the company's revenue stream, so it doesn't have quite as much of an impact.Bank of America has come a long way since the financial crisis. Since the end of 2009, the bank's tangible common-equity ratio has improved by 60%, and the bank's global liquidity sources have more than doubled.Currently, the bank's capital ratios are well in excess of regulatory requirements. Bank of America has a Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio of 11.5% and a Supplementary Leverage Ratio of 7%, well in excess of the requirements of 9.5% and 5%, respectively.One of the biggest improvements in Bank of America from an investor's perspective is consistency. As you can see from this chart, the bank's financial-crisis-era expenses are behind it. As a result, earnings have become much more consistent over the past few years. Just look at how jagged the line was as compared with 2015-present.BAC EPS Diluted (Quarterly)data by YCharts.Not only is the performance more consistent, but it's consistently improving, as well. The bank's efficiency ratiohas dropped from 70% to 63% over the past two years, and is now at a level that's comparable with industry standards. Net income has grown by 28% over the past two years, and asset quality has steadily improved.Speaking of asset quality, this is perhaps the most dramatic area of improvement over the past seven or so years. The bank's consumer net-charge-offs (NCOs) ratio has fallen from 4.51% in 2010 to 0.71% currently. U.S. consumer credit NCOs (credit cards) have dropped from 11.04% to 2.81%, a respectable level. For comparison, Capital One'sNCO ratio is 2.67%, which is certainly in the same ballpark.Image Source: Bank of America investor presentation.I mentioned earlier that Bank of America's efficiency has shown significant improvement in recent years, and a big reason for that is good expense control. Bank of America has done an excellent job of closing underperforming branches, spending less on marketing, and generally controlling all of its operating expenses.In addition, the bank has invested heavily in technology, which saves lots of money in terms of labor and other expenses. Simply put, a check deposited via a mobile app costs the bank much less to process than one that's deposited to a teller in a branch.Impressively, Bank of America's expenses over the past 12 months are 25% less than its average annual expenses from 2011-2014, despite a 6% rise in annual revenue over the past three years. Because of this, the bank is getting very close to reaching its profitability targets of a 1% return on assets and a 12% return on common tangible equity.Image Source: Bank of America investor presentation.Ever since the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has conducted stress tests and must approve of a bank's capital plan based on the test results. The growth in the amount of capital Bank of America has been permitted to return to shareholders is further evidence that this is simply not the same bank that existed just a few years ago.Image Source: Bank of America investor presentation.It's also worth noting that Bank of America is putting a particularly high emphasis on buybacks, using well over two-thirds of its capital return for that purpose. This might indicate that, even though the bank's stock has performed exceptionally well over the past year or so, management still thinks it's an attractive value.The overall tone of Bank of America's most recent presentation is that the bank has come a long way over the years since the financial crisis hit. The bank is leaner, has better asset quality, is much more financially stable, and is now starting to produce respectable, consistent results. If Bank of America continues on this path, there could be significant upside potential for its investors.10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

This has been a pain trade for many institutional and private investors, as expectations of higher interest rates and valuation calls led them to bullish decisions on the banks. On Wednesday, Bank of America  (NYSE: BAC ) rallied 2.6% as this sector received a bid. Barring an immediate reversal of Wednesday's fortune, a trade higher now seems to be in the cards.For the better part of the past couple of months, I have been telling my clients that while I don't like to be thematically long financial stocks at this juncture, this sector is the biggest wild card for me for the remainder of 2018. Why? Because should longer-term interest rates receive a renewed and sustainable bid, then this sector could quickly wake up and catch up.While I am still cautions being uber-bullish financials such as BAC stock at this point for my view is that both economic growth and inflation are peaking, from a trading perspective, and for the here and now a bullish trade does make sense.Click to EnlargeMoving averages legend: red - 200 week, blue - 100 week, yellow - 50 weekOn the multiyear weekly chart, we see that although BAC stock in 2018 largely trotted sideways thus far, it has done this in a well-defined and bullish looking consolidation pattern one could describe as a bull flag.

This also coincides with the lower end of the trading range of the past weeks.Wednesday's rally was also enough to push BAC stock out past diagonal resistance and all else being equal this now paints a marginally bullish picture, for a trade.Traders could look to buy BAC stock around the $31 area with a next upside target at $32.

Citigroup has to decide","{'$date': '2018-10-11T01:00:00Z'}","By Reuters","https://www.nasdaq.com/author/Reuters","By David HenryNEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Coand Bank of America Corp have placed the jobs of chairman and chief executive in the hands of one person, and now No. 3 Citigroup Incmust decide whether to follow suit.The matter will be resolved in the next few months as the current chairman, Mike O'Neill, reaches 72, the company's retirement age for directors. Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat will soon know if he will be taking on the additional duties of chairman or working for a new boss.Citigroup, the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets, reports third-quarter results on Friday. Investors will be watching its progress toward cost efficiency and return on equity targets, as well as revenue from its big U.S. credit card business.Six years ago O'Neill became chairman and shortly after he led the board to replace then-CEO Vikram Pandit with Corbat.O'Neill said Corbat had impressed him with his handling of some $800 billion of Citigroup assets damaged in the financial crisis.Since then Corbat, 58, has kept Citigroup on a path of improving profits and returning billions of dollars of excess capital to investors. But the recovery has been slow and has fallen short of the company's goals, as well as the performance of competitors. ""Citi needs a greater sense of urgency to improve,"" Mayo said.Under Corbat, Citigroup shares have nearly doubled. But their 91 percent gain, as of Wednesday, pales compared with the 163 percent jump for JPMorgan and the 210 percent gain for Bank of America, the biggest and second-biggest U.S. banks.Citigroup stock has lagged the past year but probably not enough for Citigroup directors to feel pressed to make big changes when O'Neill leaves, said analyst Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.""You need something like for the stock to be down 30 percent,"" he said. ""That's not what is going on here.""In the second quarter, Citigroup's return on tangible common equity was 10.8 percent compared with Bank of America's 15.15 percent and JPMorgan's 17.2 percent.Kleinhanzl said Citigroup stock is weak partly because investors doubt Citigroup can reach its target for return on tangible common equity, which rises to 13.5 percent in 2020. Getting there, Kleinhanzl said, ""is going to be a challenge.""Citigroup declined to comment on the selection of the next chairman. In a statement, it said it was successfully executing its 2017 financial plan and had updated, and in one case raised, its targets for 2020.O'Neill has publicly addressed the question of his successor at annual shareholder meetings. At the April meeting he said Corbat might become chairman and that he was ""a bit agonistic"" on whether the jobs of CEO and chairman should be kept separate.One year earlier, O'Neill said the board believed that ""an independent chairman is a good idea.""Other banks have faced shareholder votes on the issue. Bank of America took the chairmanship title away from CEO Ken Lewis in 2009 following a shareholder vote on the issue, only to give the job to CEO Brian Moynihan five years later. Since then the board has faced three shareholder votes on the question and prevailed in each.In 2013, JPMorgan directors beat back a shareholder proposal seen as calling for CEO Jamie Dimon to give up his chairmanship after a $6.2 billion trading loss.Mayo said some of Citigroup's largest shareholders have told him that they want the board to keep the chairman and chief executive roles separate. They ""would be reassured having an extra set of eyes representing their interests,"" he said.Studies are inconclusive on whether companies perform better with different people in the two posts, said Abby Adlerman, founder of consulting firm Boardspan.Adlerman said she used to advocate separating the two posts, but has come to realize that titles suggesting independence and objectivity are not as important as personalities and collaborative relationships between directors and executives.""The best CEOs, whether they are currently a chair or aspire to be a chair, realize the value of independent boards,"" said Adlerman.","Stocks,401k,BankingandLoans,Politics,Retirement","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Stocks End Horrible Week on a High Note', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/stocks-end-horrible-week-on-a-high-note-cm1036986', '_id': {'$oid': '5bc45bdfc6a722029baf6b8e'}}, {'news_title': 'Why Stocks Are Falling -- And What You Can Do About It', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-stocks-are-falling-and-what-you-can-do-about-it-cm1036987', '_id': {'$oid': '5bc45bdfc6a722029baf6b8f'}}, {'news_title': ""Here's the Earliest Age to Collect Social Security"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/heres-the-earliest-age-to-collect-social-security-cm1036985', '_id': {'$oid': '5bc45bdfc6a722029baf6b90'}}]","{'$date': '2018-10-11T01:00:00Z'}"

Let's quickly scan through the key facts from this Charlotte-based one of the world's largest financial institutions' earnings release this morning:An Earnings Beat
 BofA came out with earnings of 66 cents per share, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents.   
 Revenues and lower expenses were the key reason for the earnings beat.How Was the Estimate Revision Trend?
 You should note that the earnings estimate revisions for BofA depicted a bearish stance prior to the earnings release. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has moved 1.6% lower over the last 30 days.
 Nonetheless, BofA has an impressive earnings surprise history. Before posting the earnings beat in Q3, the company delivered positive surprises in all four trailing quarters. Overall, the company has a positive earnings surprise of 6.7% in the trailing four quarters.Higher-than-expected Revenues
 BofA posted net revenues of $22.8 billion, which was above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $22.6 billion.Key Q3 StatisticsNet income was up 32% from the year-ago quarter to $7.2 billionInvestment banking fees were $1.2 billion, down 20% year over yearSales and trading revenue (excluding net DVA) decreased 3% from the year-ago quarter to $3.1 billionProvision for credit losses declined 14% from the prior-year quarter to $716 millionNon-interest expense down 2% year over year to $13.1 billionWhat Zacks Rank Says
 At present, BofA carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, since the latest earnings performance is yet to be reflected in the estimate revisions, the rank is subject to change. While things apparently look favorable, it all depends on what sense the just-released report makes to the analysts.

More billionaires hail from the United States than from anywhere else.That will boost the 2.4 billion francsVontobel's own North American-focused Swiss Wealth Advisors now manages.""North America is one of our focus markets in which we intend to achieve above-average growth,"" Georg Schubiger, head of Vontobel Wealth Management, said on Friday.The bank aims to manage 5 billion Swiss francs for U.S. private banking clients, Chief Executive Zeno Staub said.UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank and the world's largest wealth manager, has maintained a large U.S. presence even after $780 million in settlements with U.S. authorities over undeclared assets U.S. clients had held with the bank.It books onshore business for North American clients in offices in New York and across the country, accounting for roughly half the bank's wealth management business.UBS, like other Swiss money managers, is looking to court U.S. expats as well. After merging its North American and international wealth management businesses this year, it sees opportunities with U.S. customers living and booking money abroad.The bank is expected to announce more details at an investor day on Oct. 25.COMPLEX AND EXPENSIVESize matters now that special regulations from U.S. authorities -- particularly the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act and also from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) -- have made offshore business with American customers more complex.""As a rule of thumb, you need about $2 billion in managed assets, which is quite a lot for small banks in a single market,"" Ralph Kreis, director of consulting firm AlixPartners, said.Business below that threshold is worthwhile only for institutions focusing on a specific segment or particularly profitable customers, he added.Many banks have faced challenges in building or rebuilding business with U.S. customers, Kreis said.This has dissuaded major private banks -- including Switzerland's second-biggest, Credit Suisse, and third-largest listed bank, Julius Baer-- from offering wealth management services within the United States.While the U.S. domestic private banking market is largely dominated by local players like Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Merrill Lynchand Wells Fargo, Swiss banks see lucrative opportunities in courting Americans seeking to do safe business offshore.SAFE HAVENVery wealthy individuals tend to diversify their assets over several regions, and Swiss banks see a role in offering tax-compliant investment opportunities in a stable country with a crisis-proof currency.""We offer a safe haven,"" said Vontobel manager Patrice E. Humbel, responsible for the U.S. market.""Two-thirds of our customers have European DNA. They are Germans, Italians, French or Swiss who are first-, second- or third-generation U.S. citizens.""Above a certain size, banks need a licence from the SEC to be able to offer investment products to U.S. citizens.""In Switzerland, there are about 40 to 50 firms with this licence,"" AlixPartners'Martin Buechel said.That number has roughly doubled over the last four years, said Anne Liebgott, a consultant who provides information for Americans seeking Swiss wealth management services.For practical and regulatory purposes, many banks separate their U.S. business into distinct units that operate independently and offer tailored products.Geneva-based private bank Pictet said it now manages $6.2 billion in assets out of its Pictet North America Advisors division, while UBS subsidiary Swiss Financial Advisors said it manages around 5 billion Swiss francs.($1 = 0.9957 Swiss francs)","WorldMarkets,Stocks,Economy,BankingandLoans","BAC","[{'news_title': 'A Foolish Take: The Bull Market for Dividends Is Still Strong', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/a-foolish-take-the-bull-market-for-dividends-is-still-strong-cm1040719', '_id': {'$oid': '5bcdfd1ec6a72226670748a8'}}, {'news_title': 'A Foolish Take: U.S. Mobile Ad Spending Could Surge Past $110 Billion by 2020', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/a-foolish-take-us-mobile-ad-spending-could-surge-past-110-billion-by-2020-cm1040725', '_id': {'$oid': '5bcdfd1ec6a72226670748a9'}}, {'news_title': 'Why Mirati Therapeutics Inc.

The bank said the claims were not supported by the facts or the law and it would contest anycomplaint vigorously.""It strikes us as important, though, that the matter is brought to a quick conclusion so that clarity prevails,"" it said in a research note, keeping its ""market weight"" recommendation.The analysts said they thought more than half of the 1.2 billion Swiss francs ($1.20 billion) UBS has set aside for non-core legal risks was dedicated to the U.S. case.UBS said in its statement on Wednesday it expected the DOJ to seek unspecified monetary penalties stemming from mortgage securities which date back to 2006 and 2007.UBS shares rose 1 percent in morning trading, in line with the European banking sector index <.SX7P>.The potential U.S. action is one of the last that deals with alleged misconduct in the sale and pooling of mortgage securities which helped to cause the financial crisis.Vontobel analysts said UBS's relatively modest role in the mortgage-backed securities market stood in stark contrast to that of rival banks which had already settled with U.S. authorities.The DOJ has settled similar claims with Citigroup Inc, Deutsche Bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Credit Suisse Group, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Corpand Barclays Plc.Barclays reached a $2 billion settlement in March, one of the lower payouts by banks facing such claims. The British bank had resisted a penalty proposed in initial settlement negotiations, something UBS has also done.HSBC Holdings Plcagreed to pay $765 million in October to settle with the Justice Department over its sale of defective mortgage securities, while Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, a big player in the mortgage-backed market, reached a $4.9 billion deal in May.UBS originated $1.5 billion of U.S. residential mortgages in a $5 trillion market and lost more than $45 billion when the housing market collapsed, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters.In a court case in France, which UBS has chosen not settle, the bank is fighting money laundering and tax fraud charges over allegations it helped wealthy clients avoid taxes in France. UBS denies the charges.If found guilty of money laundering, UBS could be fined up to 5 billion euros ($5.71 billion). It could also face damages awarded to the French taxman for the missing revenue, while its executives risk jail time.The French state has asked for 1.6 billion euros in damages, which UBS has called excessive.During the French investigation, UBS turned down a settlement offer of 1.1 billion euros made by the authorities, judicial sources have said.($1 = 1.0017 Swiss francs)($1 = 0.8750 euros)","Stocks,WorldMarkets,Economy,401k,BankingandLoans,Retirement","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Ionis Pharmaceuticals Collects Royalties -- and Spends It All', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/ionis-pharmaceuticals-collects-royalties-and-spends-it-all-cm1054612', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9c228c6a7226d4691ad62'}}, {'news_title': 'Tips for Investing in Australia', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/tips-for-investing-in-australia-cm1054617', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9c228c6a7226d4691ad63'}}, {'news_title': 'Why Twitter Stock Jumped 22% in October', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-twitter-stock-jumped-22-in-october-cm1054621', '_id': {'$oid': '5be9c228c6a7226d4691ad64'}}]","{'$date': '2018-11-08T03:37:00Z'}"

Soon after, bank executives found themselves hiring people to deal with delinquent loans and mortgage companies staffed up to refinance loans as interest rates fell.This time, the decline in mortgage employees may be stickier because major lenders and their technology-enabled rivals, such as Quicken and loanDepot Inc, have tried to automate much more of the business.The industry employs about 350,000 people, the same as in 2002, according to government labor data gathered by the MBA. Employment reached 500,000 at its peak during the housing bubble.JPMorgan Chase & Coand Wells Fargo & Cowere the two largest U.S. mortgage lenders during the first six months of this year, representing 7 percent of the market, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. The two recently said they had cut 400 and 600 mortgage jobs, respectively.Still, the industry is overstaffed, chief financial officers of the two banks said during earnings conference calls with analysts on Friday.""There's excess capacity in the market right now,"" said JPMorgan CFO Marianne Lake. ""It will clear itself over the course of the coming months.""High staffing levels, combined with the chill of rising interest rates on mortgage revenue, are bad for big banks' mortgage businesses, Moody's Investors Service said in a report on Wednesday.In addition to Wells and JPMorgan, other large players include Bank of America Corpand regional lenders like U.S. Bancorp.Newer mortgage companies may have the most to lose after gobbling up refinancing market share through competitive online offerings. But they have struggled to compete when providing initial loans to buy homes, experts said.Originating new mortgages remains hard to digitize, involving not just notarizing signed documents, but relationships with real estate brokers on the groundSome privately held mortgage companies that relied on refinancing are unprofitable now, said Moody's credit analyst Warren Kornfeld.""They just want revenue to cover their expense base,"" he said.Additional reporting by Richard Leong","Politics,Stocks,WorldMarkets,RealEstate","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Why This Apple Supplier Will Benefit From 5G iPhones', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-this-apple-supplier-will-benefit-from-5g-iphones-cm1055171', '_id': {'$oid': '5beaecdcc6a722ffac6cb5bf'}}, {'news_title': ""An Investor's Guide to Space"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/an-investors-guide-to-space-cm1055174', '_id': {'$oid': '5beaecdcc6a722ffac6cb5c0'}}, {'news_title': '3 Marijuana Stocks That Could Uplist Next', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-marijuana-stocks-that-could-uplist-next-cm1055177', '_id': {'$oid': '5beaecdcc6a722ffac6cb5c1'}}]","{'$date': '2018-10-18T07:33:00Z'}"

Both the banks declined to comment.Abu Dhabi, rated AA by S&P and Fitch and Aa2 by Moody's, attracted more than $30 billion in demand with its last international debt issue last year.That bond sale was split into a $3 billion tranche with a five-year maturity, $4 billion in 10-year notes and $3 billion in 30-year notes.

Lenders are also starting to cut relationships with customers who seem too risky.""We are in somewhat of a goldilocks period of banking,"" Andy Schornack, chief executive officer of Flagship Bank Minnesota, told Reuters. ""Interest rates are high enough that you can make good money and credit quality is at high enough levels where it's pretty hard to lose money.""Bank executives acknowledge that the U.S. economy is probably in the final stages of a long recovery from the 2007-09 global financial crisis. But they say that until credit metrics start to deteriorate meaningfully, there is no reason to boost reserves or slash customer financing.""There is a big disconnect at this point in time between the market technicals and what we're really seeing on the ground,"" Citigroup IncChief Financial Officer John Gerspach said at an industry event last week. ""The fundamentals still look very good.""His comments were echoed by other attendees including Bank of America CorpCEO Brian Moynihan, Wells Fargo & CoCEO Tim Sloan, and JPMorgan Chase & CoCEO Jamie Dimon.Although delinquency and default rates remain near historic lows, as do industry reserves and charge-offs for bad debt, banks have started to pull back.Nearly half of the applications from customers with low credit scores were rejected in the four months ending in October, compared with 43 percent in the year-ago period, according to a survey released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Banks shuttered 7 percent of existing accounts, particularly among subprime borrowers, the highest rate since the Fed started conducting surveys in 2013.Home-equity lines of credit declined 8 percent across the industry, with growth slowing in areas such as credit cards and commercial-and-industrial loans, the survey showed.Capital One Financial Corp, one of the biggest U.S. card lenders, is restricting how much it lends to each customer even as it aggressively recruits new ones, CEO Richard Fairbank said at the event last week.""We have been more cautious in the extension of credit, initial credit lines, the broad-based credit line increase programs,"" he said. ""At this point in the cycle, we're going to hold back on that option a bit.""Executives at regional banks also say they have become more cautious lately. They avoid financing riskier projects like early-stage construction loans and properties without pre-lease agreements.New Jersey'sOceanFirst Bank has also pulled back on refinancing transactions that let customers cash out on their debt, and has started reducing exposure to industrial loans, CEO Chris Maher told Reuters.""In a downturn, industrial property is extremely illiquid,"" he said. ""If you don't want it and it's not needed it could be almost valueless.""Such data points, combined with the looming threat of an inverted yield curve, have sent bank stocks down more than 13 percent since the first trading day of the month, according to the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index.Even so, bankers and analysts say the next recession will look much more like the 2001 tech bubble bursting than the 2007-09 global financial crisis.""I lived through the pain of the last recession,"" said Schornack.

The U.S. Treasury secretary on Sunday used the language of financial meltdowns to address rather more pedestrian issues: falling stocks, another government shutdown, and President Donald Trump's latest attack on the Federal Reserve. Rather than easing U.S. market worries, his alarmism adds to them.Absent such a debacle, the chances are that most market players are going to see Mnuchin's pre-Christmas missive in one of three ways. It could be another attempt by the administration to shift any blame for recent market ructions - which include a 7 percent slide in the S&P 500 Index of U.S. stocks last week - away from Trump's policies, which aside from crimping international trade have brought another partial government shutdown over his demands for border-wall funding. The president himself has criticised Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell over the central bank's interest-rate hikes, although Mnuchin over the weekend attempted to show Trump dialling down his critique.Alternatively, the Treasury secretary's intervention may be the action of someone trying to look relevant after being overshadowed by his boss and other economic-policy advisers in the administration. Or it could simply be a mix of poor counsel and his own inexperience. It doesn't help that Treasury's memo, among other typos, misspells the name of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and was rushed out on Twitter.These interpretations should help investors avoid overreacting, but they don't offer much comfort in the longer run. One danger is that money managers ignore the next warning from Mnuchin, even if it is better founded. Another is that, when the next crisis does arrive, there's no confidence in his ability to handle it.On Twitter,(graphic)CONTEXT NEWS- U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the chief executives of America's six largest banks on Dec. 23, he and the Treasury said in tweets on the same day. ""The CEOs confirmed that they have ample liquidity available"" to lend to people and businesses,"" the Treasury said in a statement attached to the tweets. They also told Mnuchin they had not experienced ""any clearing or margin issues and that the markets continue to function properly"".- The six banks are Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo.- The statement also said Mnuchin intends on Dec. 24 to host a telephone meeting with the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes representatives from the Federal Reserve, Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The bank now says the total sum may come to half that (graphic).Numerous other banks have paid billions to resolve federal and state RMBS-related claims, including JP Morgan, Citi, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and UBS.Last May, Royal Bank of Scotlandagreed to pay $4.9 billion to settle a U.S. mortgages investigation.

The $100.2 million in fines are the toughest actions yet taken by the regulator as part of its campaign against what it sees as shoddy listing standards.Helping firms to list is big business in Hong Kong, which was last year's top IPO destination worldwide with $36.3 billion raised, according to Refinitiv data.But, in the wake of a slew of scandals among newly traded firms earlier this decade, the SFC has been cracking down on banks not properly carrying out their duties as sponsor.Hong Kong IPOs need at least one sponsoring bank, which typically takes the lead in running the IPO and collects a larger proportion of fees than banks listed only as bookrunners.Sponsors must conduct due diligence to assess the company being listed, and are responsible for assuring potential investors that its IPO prospectus is accurate.The IPOs in question were those of China Forestry, sponsored by UBS and Standard Chartered, and Tianhe Chemicals, sponsored by UBS, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.UBS was also fined for failing to discharge its duties in a third IPO which the regulator did not name, but which sources have identified as China Metal Recycling (CMR), a now-defunct scrap merchant.""The outcome of these enforcement actions for sponsor failures ... signify the crucial importance that the SFC places on the high standards of sponsors' conduct to protect the investing public and maintain the integrity and reputation of Hong Kong's financial markets,"" said Ashley Alder, chief executive of the SFC, in a statement.SCEPTICISM FAILURESFines in Hong Kong are based on up to three times the fees or profits made by the regulated group or person, less a discount for cooperation with the investigation. Morgan Stanley was fined more than Bank of America Merrill Lynch by the regulator because it took more of the fees from Tianhe for the IPO.China Forestry raised $216 million in its 2009 IPO. Just 14 months after listing, trading of its shares was suspended when its auditor discovered irregularities. The company was subsequently liquidated.Tianhe, engaged in the manufacture and sale of chemical products, listed in 2014 but was soon after targetted by a short seller, who claimed it had inflated profits and presented related groups as customers. The company denied the allegations.Trading in its shares has been suspended since 2015.Among the failings described by the regulator was one instance where none of the three banks sponsoring Tianhe Chemical's IPO followed up after interviewing the company's largest customer as part of their sponsor due diligence.The meeting was arranged by Tianhe at its offices and the customer, named only as X, refused to give a business card or provide other identification to the banks' representatives before storming out of the meeting.In the case of China Forestry, the SFC said UBS did not inspect any of the company's forests after joining StanChart as a co-sponsor of the deal.

A nervous Wall Street is keen to see how hostile the panel will be towards the industry.Republicans have also criticized Wells Fargo, and will likely want proof the fourth-largest U.S. bank has addressed customer abuses.The CEOs of Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Coand Bank of America Corpare expected to appear before the House panel next month.Stakes are high for 31-year Wells Fargo veteran Sloan, who was appointed CEO when John Stumpf retired soon after the sales practices scandal erupted in 2016. Sloan has faced calls to step down from investors and politicians, including U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a 2020 Democratic presidential contender.Wells Fargo shares were up 0.3 percent as the hearing started.Sloan's prepared remarks emphasized changes the bank has made to culture, sales practices and risk management, as well as efforts to repay wronged customers.""Wells Fargo is a better bank than it was three years ago, and we are working every day to become even better,"" Sloan, 58, will say, according to testimony published by the bank on Monday.Lawmakers could also ask about the bank's decision to cut thousands of U.S. jobs, its pledge to boost stock buybacks and its forced arbitration policy for customers.Spokespeople for Waters and Ocasio-Cortez declined or did not respond to comment requests. Porter said in a statement on Monday that Sloan has ""a lot to prove"" to show Wells Fargo has turned a corner.If lawmakers are unhappy with what they hear, they could pressure the Federal Reserve to maintain restrictions imposed on the bank's growth until governance and risk management improve.Sloan has not appeared before Congress since a 2017 Senate hearing, where he clashed with lawmakers from both parties.Wells Fargo has since deployed more lobbyists in Washington and launched a public relations offensive, but remains in politicians' crosshairs.The 2016 revelation that Wells Fargo created millions of fake customer accounts prompted regulatory probes into mortgage foreclosures, auto insurance sales and its wealth management businesses, resulting in billions of dollars in fines.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,BankingandLoans,Politics","BAC","[{'news_title': 'The 3 Most Important Takeaways From Marijuana Stock CannTrust’s Earnings', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/the-3-most-important-takeaways-from-marijuana-stock-canntrusts-earnings-cm1121823', '_id': {'$oid': '5c9e0ec683ce4541eff54d9c'}}, {'news_title': 'Wells Fargo (WFC) CEO Sloan Announces Plan to Step Down', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/wells-fargo-wfc-ceo-sloan-announces-plan-to-step-down-cm1121824', '_id': {'$oid': '5c9e0ec683ce4541eff54d9d'}}, {'news_title': ""Despite Cronos Group's Lull, Altria's Return on Investment Is Smoking Hot So Far"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/despite-cronos-groups-lull-altrias-return-on-investment-is-smoking-hot-so-far-cm1121812', '_id': {'$oid': '5c9e0ec683ce4541eff54d9e'}}]","{'$date': '2019-03-12T06:00:00Z'}"

As part of its initial public offering last year, China's Teslawannabe blocked financial advisers from working with electric-car rivals for a year, Reuters reported on Friday. The cutthroat tactic betrays a sense of urgency as founder William Li rushes to build his business and brand. Neither bankers nor automakers have much to gain, however.That ratchets up pressure to raise funds. Nio, for one, is burning cash to kick-start deliveries whilst developing a luxury marque akin to Elon Musk's Tesla. The Shanghai-based company reported a $3.4 billion net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders last year as it shelled out for third-party production, swanky showrooms and a globetrotting racing team.Pricey efforts to conquer a fledgling market are reminiscent of new tech ventures. Industries such as ride-hailing and payments are often winner-takes-all, or winner-takes-most. That isn't the case for cars. Automakers don't need a monopoly or a network effect to succeed. In that context, attempting to prevent rivals from accessing capital by temporarily cutting them off from leading financial advisers is misplaced financial road rage.For banks, there's no need to back a single winner so early in the race. In fact, doing so could mean missing out on other opportunities. Nio's spending rate does suggest it will need to keep coming back for more, so it helps to be riding shotgun. To wit, the eight banks on the IPO, including Citigroup, JPMorganand Goldman Sachs, also worked on the issuer's subsequent $750 million convertible bond earlier this year.Since Nio's market debut in September, however, fellow Chinese electric-car outfits Xiaopeng, Byton and Leap have all expressed interest in going public, according to media reports. The non-compete deal with Nio will complicate efforts to advise them. Entrepreneurs and investment bankers alike are renowned for their competitive streaks.

Citi and Bank of America last year said they would no longer provide certain banking services to gun manufacturers.Some Republican lawmakers criticized such policies on Wednesday, with Representative Bill Posey cautioning banks against withholding financing from legal business and Representative Sean Duffy accusing Bank of America of denying Americans their Second Amendment rights.Waters also questioned three of the bank CEOs whether they had found suspicious activity within their banks related to Russian accounts.Citi CEO Michael Corbat declined to comment, citing an ongoing investigation into the matter. The Bank of America and Morgan Stanley CEOs said they had conducted internal investigations and did not find any suspicious activity.Dimon said that JPMorgan ""will never lose sight of what we learned."" Still, the bank has taken steps that went a long way to preventing another crisis, Dimon argued.Since the crisis, the country's largest banks have added more than $800 billion in capital to bolster the financial system. In the months leading up to the hearing, the banks also made a string of announcements to show how they are helping customers and communities.Bank of America said on Tuesday it would raise its minimum hourly wage to $20 from $15 by 2021.Last month, JPMorgan said it would no longer finance the private prison industry and would invest $350 million in job training programs.Goldman Sachs has publicly set targets for hiring women and minority groups, a move Citigroup also made late last year.Wells Fargo & Cowas not present at the hearing since former CEO Tim Sloan resigned abruptly last month, two weeks after appearing before the same committee.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,BankingandLoans,Politics","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Validea Peter Lynch Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 5/31/2019', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-peter-lynch-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-5312019-cm1156983', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf0e58d83ce45048fab80f8'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Motley Fool Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 5/31/2019', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-motley-fool-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-5312019-cm1156982', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf0e58d83ce45048fab80f9'}}, {'news_title': 'Validea Kenneth Fisher Strategy Daily Upgrade Report - 5/31/2019', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/validea-kenneth-fisher-strategy-daily-upgrade-report-5312019-cm1156981', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf0e58d83ce45048fab80fa'}}]","{'$date': '2019-04-10T06:00:00Z'}"

The kind where you sleep well at night, travel freely and still have money left over to help out your kids and grandkids... It's very unlikely that you'll be able to generate enough income for that lifestyle through simply stocks and bonds.Consider this…These three companies are about to beat cancerIt isn't a new drug. It isn't a pill, cream, spray, ointment, or any other medical treatment you've have heard of. Instead, it's a new class of blood cells that could be all you'll need to cure 12 types of cancer... to eradicate heart disease... diabetes... arthritis... Alzheimer's... and extend your life by another 50 vibrant years.You can get the full details here.Let's say you collect Social Security, but you estimate that you'll need an additional $45,000 a year in income to maintain a comfortable standard of living in your golden years. That means, with a $250,000 portfolio, you'd need to generate around 18% annual returns just to pay yourself without losing any capital. With a $500,000 portfolio, you'd need about 9%.If you have more than that, you're in a better position, but there are still many future costs that could drain your nest egg in a hurry.But what if I told you that there's a way to earn additional income -- as high as, say, $1,400 a month -- from stocks you already own? Even better, what I'm about to tell you is one of the safest income-producing strategies around, and it's been used by people ""in the know"" for decades.Before I reveal exactly what it is I'm talking about, let me give you an analogy...Most people would think it foolish to own an investment property and not rent it out. After all, if you owned an $80,000 apartment in Boston, Houston or Seattle, you'd be able to collect about $500 a month in rent, depending on the neighborhood.Sounds like a no-brainer, right?Likewise, if you owned $80,000 worth of stock in companies like Apple, Facebook or Intel, you could essentially do the same thing. That's because the stocks in your brokerage account can also generate monthly income, much like a rental property. But unlike with real estate, most people don't take advantage of this with their stocks.When you think about it this way, it's utterly unbelievable that more people aren't doing this.The good news is that collecting additional income on your stocks isn't difficult. In fact, you can do it with blocks of just 100 shares, with nearly every stock listed on the Nasdaq and the NYSE.See, many investors simply hold stocks in their investment accounts and hope that their dividends and capital gains will be enough.But you can do better than that by using an incredibly safe strategy that lets you make a deal with other traders who want to pay you cash upfront -- money you can funnel into your brokerage account -- for the opportunity to buy your stock from you at a higher price.To be absolutely clear: Someone will pay you cash for the opportunity to buy your stock at a higher price than it is trading for today. You also get to set the price at which you would be willing to sell your shares. If the shares don't trade for that agreed upon price within a certain time frame then you get to keep the cash they paid... and your shares.Sounds too good to be true, right? Don't be fooled: it's real and it works. I use this strategy myself to generate extra money for my day-to-day living costs. It can cover your monthly bills... medical expenses... even provide you with additional income for the things you otherwise couldn't afford, like taking lavish vacations.However you choose to use this money, it's one of the safest ways to generate extra income from the stocks you already have in your portfolio. In fact, I can't think of a better strategy for retirees looking to boost their income.Lower Your Risk, Boost Your Income ​The strategy I'm talking about is an ""options"" strategy. But don't worry, it's completely unlike any riskyoptions tradingyou may have heard about.In fact, this strategy is the main risk reduction technique used by wealthy people and professional money managers to safeguard their wealth. For them, the main purpose is to reduce the risk of holding such large quantities of stock. The fact that this strategy also produces income in the process is an added bonus.But for ordinary investors like you and me, both of these benefits are equally important.Like I said, this is an especially great source of money if you're retired, approaching retirement, or just want to boost your monthly income. Even The Wall Street Journal says, ""[It] generates income and can juice your returns in any market.""The technique is called ""selling covered calls"" or ""covered call writing.""Here's how I explain covered calls to new readers of my premium newsletter, Maximum Income.A call option is simply the right -- but not the obligation -- to buy a stock at a specified price before a specified date. Selling a covered call obligates us to sell that stock to the call buyer if it moves above a specified price (the option's ""strike price""). When we accept that obligation, we receive instant income upfront (known as a ""premium""). You can be asked to sell the stock at any time between the moment you collect the premium and the expiration of the option contract. To minimize risk, we will only sell calls on stocks that we own 100 shares of -- that's what makes it a ""covered"" call.Now perhaps the best way to understand how this works is to give you an example.How We Got A ""Bonus Dividend"" From Bank of America My Maximum Incomereaders and I recently made a covered call trade on Bank of America (NYSE:BAC).If you want to know why I like owning the company in today's environment, suffice it to say that with interest rates on the rise, I think the major banks -- and BAC in particular -- are poised to do well for investors.There is, of course, just one problem. At a yield of 2.17%, the income produced from owning BAC leaves a little more to be desired for most investors. That's where covered calls come in.Now keep in mind that I did not make a habit of revealing the exact details of my trades. That information is normally reserved for my Maximum Income subscribers only. I am, however, going to make an exception today and reveal a recent trade we made so you can see exactly what I mean when I say it's the best bet for investors looking to supplement their income.When I originally issued this recommendation, BAC was trading around $29.10. So I recommend that Maximum Incomereaders buy 100 shares of BAC and then sell one BAC Apr 29 Call for every 100 shares of BAC they purchased. That's a call option on BAC with a strike price of $29 that expired on April 18.At the time, these call options were trading around $0.63 per share. The goal was to enter this trade at a cost basis of $28.50 or less. Your cost basis is simply the price you purchase shares at minus the premium per share received when selling the call.Now from this point, one of two things can happen -- and both of them are pretty good scenarios, depending on how you look at it.Assuming BAC trades for $29 or less on April 18, we'd keep the $63 we received from the premium on $2,910, earning 2.2% in 31 days. I know that may not sound like much, but remember, this is the same amount of income we'd earn in an entire year of owning BAC. If we can repeat a similar trade every 31 days, we'd earn a 72% return on our capital in 12 months.If BAC trades above $29, our stock will be called. In that case, we will sell the shares for $29. In the most conservative case, we'd realize a profit of $0.50 per share ($29 - $28.50 cost basis), or $50 per 100 shares. This is a profit of 1.9% in 31 days. If we can repeat a similar trade every 31 days, we'd earn a 58% return on our cost basis in 12 months.More Investors Should Be Doing This... I know there are a lot of numbers I threw out there, but hopefully you understand that what we're essentially talking about here is a ""win-win"". Either a potential 2.2% ""bonus dividend"" that we can earn agan and again -- on a stock that only yields 2% per year... or nab a quick 2% gain on a solid stock in a month.Frankly, I'm happy to take either. That's why thousands of investors have joined me over at Maximum Income. They're not content to simply accept the income offered by traditional stocks and bonds. Honestly, in this low-rate environment, it's just not going to cut it -- and I don't know why more investors aren't doing this.Part of the reason could be that they simply aren't even aware it exists. Or maybe they think it's too risky or complicated. But nothing could be further from the truth.That's why I'm happy to tell you about my research report, which explains how covered calls work, and how you can use it to generate hundreds -- even thousands -- of dollars per month, no matter whether the stock market is moving up, down or sideways.If you'd like to learn more, simply go here.This Indicator Helps Small Traders Profit Along With Big Ones3 ""Weird"" Indicators That Could Be Pointing To A RecessionThe Perfect Stock To Own In This Job MarketThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.© Copyright 2001-2016 StreetAuthority, LLC.

Barclaysis plotting a revival of its Asian investment bank, defying activist Edward Bramson just weeks after he failed to convince fellow shareholders to back radical cuts to the British bank's trading arm.Chief Executive Jes Staley wants to make Barclays Europe's premier investment bank and then take on its global rivals by building up beyond its core European and U.S. markets.""Today we see our peers and principal competition as being the U.S. banks - and we can, and do, compete with them,"" Staley says of the business he hopes will be his greatest legacy.Staley and his executive committee (ExCo) want to regrow Barclays' Asian markets business with dozens of hires in the next two to three years, expanding its global banking business there and reversing a 2016 regional retrenchment.As Europe's economic fortunes wane and competition in the U.S. tightens, selective expansion in Asia might be Barclays' best shot at increasing market share.""If you want to be relevant to global clients, you have to be in Asia,"" Stephen Dainton, head of global markets at Barclays, told Reuters.Staley has been ruthless in his mission to preserve and promote the Barclays corporate and investment bank (CIB) since Bramson appeared on its shareholder register two years ago, moving closer to the day-to-day operation of its business after ousting investment bank boss Tim Throsby in March.""That clear and unequivocal backing from the top really matters to colleagues in the CIB and I'm glad to give it,"" said Staley, who has also driven fresh forays into higher-risk, higher-reward businesses including leveraged finance and global securitisation..'BIGGER WAY'Staley's direct approach is translating into investment in technology and new hires, Barclays executives said.Barclays' head of global banking Joe McGrath says his business could hire up to 200 staff in the next two to three years, although this could be fewer if deal flow is slower and the plan depends on improving profitability in the UK and U.S.""I want to invest in Asia and we will invest in the near term on a very measured basis but at some point, we'll need to take a harder look at what we want to do in a bigger way,"" McGrath told Reuters, adding that growth markets like China and Southeast Asia will offer investment banking opportunities.The move to expand the global footprint of the Barclays investment bank is gutsy in view of its recent underperformance.First quarter returns in the investment banking business fell to 9.5% from 13.2% a year ago, leaving group targets for 9% returns on tangible equity close but unachieved.Investors also want to see Staley's talk of progress better reflected in its share price, which has fallen 30 percent since he took the top job in December 2015.Despite this slump, Barclays has been the second-best performer among European investment banks since Staley's arrival.""We've still got a way to go to get to the returns we should be generating, and I want to more directly support that effort,"" Staley said of the demands ahead.Barclays wants to grow its Asian headcount in the markets business by 10-11%, or around 60 people, over the next two to three years, Dainton said, adding that in the medium term Asia could deliver between 15-20% of the group's total revenues, up from 10% now.But it is sidestepping the Asia cash equities business it closed in 2016 and hiring in other trading businesses that play more to Barclays' traditional strengths.These include emerging markets-focused business in Singapore, its Hong Kong-based credit trading desk, foreign exchange, and electronic trading capabilities.""It's critically important for us that we have good connectivity across the three financial centres, Europe, U.S. and Asia,"" Kristen Macleod, managing director of Barclays' forex sales business in New York, said.""The markets business has outperformed our U.S. peers for six consecutive quarters …. we are one of the few banks on the street right now that are investing and growing this business.""'MISSION CRITICAL'Insiders say they like Staley's hands-to-the-pump attitude, sharing anecdotes of him pitching clients and jumping on aeroplanes to seal deals and poach talent from other banks.But as demands of the investment bank grow, Staley is relying on the likes of McGrath, Dainton and his inner circle to quell calls he might be neglecting other parts of the bank.Although fallout from last month's shake-up in the investment bank's pay structure, tying bonus payouts to profits generated in a given time period, could tarnish Barclays' year, Staley's lieutenants are in no doubt what they have to do.""The overarching theme in these ExCo meetings is that it is mission critical we drive results and generate returns for our shareholders, sooner rather than later,"" Macleod said.","WorldMarkets,Stocks,Economy,BankingandLoans,Technology","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Relocating?

At Bank of America, expenses declined by 4 percent.JPMorgan Chase & Co , the country's biggest bank by assets, has been the exception. It increased revenue and beat expectations while seeing expenses rise as it invests in new technology.Allowing for different tax treatments on some assets, Bank of America said revenue came in at $23.2 billion. That compared with the average analyst estimate of $23.3 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio told analysts on a conference call that the bank anticipates its net interest income will rise by 3 percent in 2019, compared with 6 percent last year.""We've got some near-term headwinds,"" he said.The Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise interest rates in 2019 given risks to the U.S. economy from a global slowdown. Investors fear that could pressure net interest income, or the difference between what a bank earns on loans and pays on deposits.The bank saw 3 percent growth in consumer loans and 4 percent growth in loans to businesses in the first quarter, allowing it to capture more revenue from higher U.S. interest rates. The company reported a 5 percent increase in deposits from a year earlier.Revenue rose in two of the lender's four main businesses.Donofrio said growth in the bank's deposits and loans suggested the performance of the U.S. economy remained solid despite recession concerns.""Bank of America has demonstrated for years now that we can grow well in an economy that is just growing moderately,"" he told reporters on a conference call.Chief Executive Brian Moynihan cited demand for credit from middle-market business. He said that was ""good news for the economy overall.""The lender has benefited from the central bank's four rate hikes in 2018. It relies heavily on higher interest rates to maximize profits as it has a large deposit pool and retains rate-sensitive mortgage securities.Net interest income - the difference between what a lender earns on loans and pays on deposits - rose 5 percent to $12.38 billion. Deposits on average also rose nearly 5 percent to $1.36 trillion.However, the bank's trading desks, like those of its peers, have had a slow start this year because of the U.S. government shutdown and lower volatility. Changes in the U.S. tax code and concerns about a trade war spurred more trading a year ago.Overall trading revenue declined 17 percent. Equities trading revenue fell 22 percent and fixed-income trading revenue slipped 8 percent.Advisory fees at Bank of America stayed flat, indicating the bank is missing out on the M&A boom lifting rival investment banks. On Monday, Goldman Sachs Group Inc reported a 51 percent surge in advisory fees.Net income applicable to common shareholders rose 6 percent to $6.87 billion.Excluding one-time items, the bank earned 71 cents per share, beating the 66 cents per share analysts on average had expected, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","FundamentalAnalysis,Stocks,WorldMarkets,BankingandLoans,Earnings","BAC","[{'news_title': 'This High-Yield Stock Is Making All the Right Moves', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/this-high-yield-stock-is-making-all-the-right-moves-cm1157823', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf2a55583ce45105b8278e9'}}, {'news_title': 'Better Marijuana Stock: HEXO vs. Supreme Cannabis', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/better-marijuana-stock-hexo-vs-supreme-cannabis-cm1157824', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf2a55583ce45105b8278ea'}}, {'news_title': 'Customers Still Love Alaska Airlines More Than Delta', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/customers-still-love-alaska-airlines-more-than-delta-cm1157825', '_id': {'$oid': '5cf2a55583ce45105b8278eb'}}]","{'$date': '2019-04-16T07:15:00Z'}"

The report is based on EPFR data.That marked the 13th straight week of bond inflows as worries about the slowing global economy pushed investors into assets considered safe in times of economic and political strife.That contrasts with $2.6 billion out of European equities, $1.6 billion out of U.S. stocks.Technology was the only equity sector winner with $1 billion inflows, it said.

""Oil (revenues) being so bad has brought this to the forefront.""The world's 12 biggest investment banks earned a combined $2.5 billion from power, natural gas and metals last year, according to previously unpublished data provided to Reuters by consultancy. That's more than five times the $450 million they made from oil.Four headhunters specialising in commodities positions said hiring in the oil sector fell 20%-25% over the last 18 months or so. Hiring of power and gas specialists, meanwhile, rose about 20% and there was an increase in metals desks of 5%-10%.Investment banks regularly chop and change teams depending on which markets are the most profitable and some consultants say the latest shift is just the result of a poor performance in oil over the last two years.In some cases, investment banks have just been rebuilding power and gas teams they had a few years ago. Recruiters and industry sources say oil is still the best staffed commodities business, with power and gas in second place and metals third.But some believe the greening of industries and economies could eventually lead to a change in the hierarchy.""In the next five years, banks may have more people in power and gas than in oil,"" said Dylan Pany at recruitment consultants Phaidon International.CRUDE EARNINGSOverall, commodities businesses have become far less profitable for investment banks as tougher capital regulations have reduced their ability to take positions in physical markets, or own assets such as warehouses for metals.Some banks suffered huge commodities losses during the financial crisis and performances since have been patchy, leading them to cut back on commodities operations. That has allowed trading giants and brokers subject to less onerous regulation to take the lion's share of the commodities market.According to Coalition data, net revenue from commodities at the 12 largest investment banks, a group including Morgan Stanley , JPMorgan Chaseand Goldman Sachs , plunged from more than $13 billion in 2009 to $2.5 billion in 2017 and $3.6 billion last year. Coalition measures income from trading, selling derivatives and other activities.But revenues from oil, which typically accounted for a quarter to a third of the overall commodities income, slumped the most over the last few years.Behind the recent weakness was lack of demand for hedging and trading losses at several banks in the second half of last year, said Coalition research director Amrit Shahani. ""Client activity was low and trading conditions were difficult.""Oil prices plunged during the last quarter of 2018 from a four-year high of $86.74 a barrel in October to below $50 at the end of December. Oil prices have bounced back somewhat this year boosting revenues, though Shahani said banks might have earned more if they hadn't been cutting back their oil teams and being more cautious in trading.Investor interest in metals, power, gas and carbon prices, meanwhile, has revived in part thanks to price rallies and bumper trading volumes.Metal prices surged from 2016 to the middle of 2018 after an environmental clampdown on polluting smelters and mines in China threatened to curtail supply. Some metals, such as copper and nickel, have also been boosted by hopes electrification will require more material for wiring and batteries, although a trade row between Washington and Beijing has since weighed on prices.High volumes and volatility in gas futures on the U.S. NYMEX exchange also created opportunities for banks to make money, while European carbon permits, which come under banks' power and gas desks, have tripled in price since the start of 2018.HIRING AND FIRINGIndustry sources said banks including Citi , JPMorgan and Bank of Americahave been building up their power and gas businesses in the United States, where Goldman Sachs has also expanded in power.In Europe, Morgan Stanley has re-entered the gas and power market after leaving in 2015 and now has three to five people, while Bank of America, which left the market in 2014, has returned with about three people, sources said.HSBC , meanwhile, has expanded in industrial metals after pulling back in the mid-2000s and now has a handful of staff in trading and sales, sources said.""Our clients have also increasingly been asking for us to provide base metals coverage as existing providers have scaled back,"" said HSBC's head of precious metals, Paul Voller.Citi, JPMorgan, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.Commodity Appointments said they had placed almost 20% fewer staff in oil departments across the industry - including banks, brokers and trading firms - in the first quarter of 2019 compared with the same period of 2018. Placements in power and gas rose by about 15% and in metals by 7%.Phaidon International said hiring in gas and power was up 15%-20% over the past year compared to the previous year. Metals hires were up 5%-10% while oil was down 25%.Eleven Recruitment said it placed no one in an investment bank oil team in the 2018-19 financial year but demand for gas and power specialists was so strong it changed its name last year from Oil Recruitment.Proco Commodities' Funnell said hiring in power and gas was up across the industry by some 20%, with areas such as market analysis and origination - finding and signing clients - up 40-50%. But the number of oil trading placements Proco has made since 2017 has halved, said chief executive Chris Powell.The 12 banks included in Coalition's data are Bank of America, Barclays , BNP Paribas , Citi, Credit Suisse , Deutsche Bank , Goldman Sachs, HSBC, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley, Societe Generaleand UBS .Together they account for about two-thirds of total investment bank earnings in commodities, according to Coalition data.

But Deutsche's efforts to compete with U.S. rivals have been hampered by litigation and regulatory investigations.Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing, who is battling to turn the bank around, said the Fed's decision was ""excellent news"" in a memo to staff on its website.""Achieving success here was one of the key goals we set a year ago. It is a huge step forward for our business in the U.S. and globally. A strong operating platform in the Americas is essential to our clients,"" he said.The Fed approved the capital plans of the 16 others in this year's test, including the biggest U.S. banks such as JPMorgan Chase , Bank of Americaand Citigroup .JPMorgan, following the test results, announced plans to increase its quarterly dividend to 90 cents per share from 80 cents, starting in the third quarter, and buy back up to $29.4 billion of shares over the next year.JPMorgan shares rose as much as 1.9% while Bank of America was up 1.8% and Citigroup advanced 1.5% after-the-bell.JPMorgan was asked to resubmit its proposal after the Fed assessed its initial plan would result in it falling below the minimum capital it is required to hold to cope with a downturn.Banks normally resubmit when they are pushing to return the maximum amount of capital possible to shareholders and overestimate what the Fed will allow them to do in their initial proposal, banking and regulatory sources say.STRONG CAPITAL LEVELSThe Fed's stamp of approval gives Deutsche Bank a major boost as it works on a restructuring plan after it flunked the test in 2015, 2016 and 2018. Another failure would have further damaged confidence among clients and investors.The stress test outcome means that Deutsche is now free to make payments to its German parent without approval from the Fed, a restriction imposed after its failure last year.The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, ordered Credit Suisse to address weaknesses in its capital adequacy process by October, and restricted its capital distributions to last year's levels until the weaknesses are addressed.The Fed said it had identified ""weaknesses in the assumptions used by the firm to project stressed trading losses that raise concerns about the firm's capital adequacy and capital planning process."" It gave no further detail.Credit Suisse, in an emailed statement, acknowledged the concerns relayed by the Fed and said it expected to remediate the issues by the October deadline.In Zurich, a spokesman said the test would not affect Credit Suisse's payout to shareholders.The Fed said in a statement that the nation's largest banks all have strong capital levels and ""virtually all"" are meeting supervisory expectations for capital planning.Deutsche's passing grade reflected the significant progress in addressing its weaknesses around capital planning, although some issues remain, a senior Fed official said.Deutsche's Sewing told investors at the annual shareholders' meeting last month that the bank planned to make ""tough cutbacks"" at its investment bank to appease investors unhappy with its underperformance. Those plans are likely to see the bank's U.S. equities business shrunk to a skeleton operation, Reuters reported this month.All 18 banks cleared the first portion of the Fed's annual stress test last week, showing they would easily have enough capital to keep lending during a severe economic downturn.The second test was more rigorous, assessing whether it is safe for banks to implement their capital plans.($1 = 0.8801 euros)","Stocks,WorldMarkets,401k,BankingandLoans,Politics,Retirement","BAC","[{'news_title': 'A Conversation on ESG Investing With JUST Capital CEO Martin Whittaker', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/a-conversation-on-esg-investing-with-just-capital-ceo-martin-whittaker-cm1170386', '_id': {'$oid': '5d16676e83ce4561bff9e23b'}}, {'news_title': 'Why Shares of EQT Are Trading Higher on Friday', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/why-shares-of-eqt-are-trading-higher-on-friday-cm1170387', '_id': {'$oid': '5d16676e83ce4561bff9e23c'}}, {'news_title': ""Friday's ETF with Unusual Volume: ACWX"", 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/fridays-etf-with-unusual-volume-acwx-cm1170378', '_id': {'$oid': '5d16676e83ce4561bff9e23d'}}]","{'$date': '2019-06-28T04:09:00Z'}"

Huffstutter and Jason LangeCHICAGO/WASHINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - In the wake of the U.S. housing meltdown of the late 2000s, JPMorgan Chase & Co hunted for new ways to expand its loan business beyond the troubled mortgage sector.The nation's largest bank found enticing new opportunities in the rural Midwest - lending to U.S. farmers who had plenty of income and collateral as prices for grain and farmland surged.But now - after years of falling farm income and an intensifying U.S.-China trade war - JPMorgan and other Wall Street banks are heading for the exits, according to a Reuters analysis of the farm-loan holdings they reported to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).The agricultural loan portfolios of the nation's top 30 banks fell by $3.9 billion, to $18.3 billion, between their peak in December 2015 and March 2019, the analysis showed. That's a 17.5% decline. GRAPHIC:Reuters identified the largest banks by their quarterly filings of loan performance metrics with the FDIC and grouped together banks owned by the same holding company. The banks were ranked by total assets in the first quarter of this year.The retreat from agricultural lending by the nation's biggest banks, which has not been previously reported, comes as shrinking cash flow is pushing some farmers to retire early and others to declare bankruptcy, according to farm economists, legal experts, and a review of hundreds of lawsuits filed in federal and state courts.Sales of many U.S. farm products - including soybeans, the nation's most valuable agricultural export - have fallen sharply since China and Mexico last year imposed tariffs in retaliation for U.S. duties on their goods. The trade-war losses further strained an agricultural economy already reeling from years over global oversupply and low commodity prices.Chapter 12 federal court filings, a type of bankruptcy protection largely for small farmers, increased from 361 filings in 2014 to 498 in 2018, according to federal court records.""My phone is ringing constantly. It's all farmers,"" said Minneapolis-St. Paul area bankruptcy attorney Barbara May. ""Their banks are calling in the loans and cutting them off.""Surveys show demand for farm credit continues to grow, particularly among Midwest grain and soybean producers, said regulators at the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis and Kansas City. U.S. farmers rely on loans to buy or refinance land and to pay for operational expenses such as equipment, seeds and pesticides.Fewer loan options can threaten a farm's survival, particularly in an era when farm incomes have been cut nearly in half since 2013.Gordon Giese, a 66-year-old dairy and corn farmer in Mayville, Wisconsin, last year was forced to sell most of his cows, his farmhouse and about one-third of his land to clear his farm's debt. Now, his wife works 16-hour shifts at a local nursing home to help pay bills.Giese and two of his sons tried and failed to get a line of credit for the farm.""If you have any signs of trouble, the banks don't want to work with you,"" said Giese, whose experience echoes dozens of other farmers interviewed by Reuters. ""I don't want to get out of farming, but we might be forced to.""Michelle Bowman, a governor at the U.S. Federal Reserve, told an agricultural banking conference in March that the sharp decline in farm incomes was a ""troubling echo"" of the 1980s farm crisis, when falling crop and land prices, amid rising debt, lead to mass loan defaults and foreclosures.JPMorgan Chase'sFDIC-insured units pared $245 million, or 22%, of their farm-loan holdings between the end of 2015 and March 31 of this year.JPMorgan Chase did not dispute Reuters' findings but said it has not ""strategically reduced"" its exposure to the farm sector. The bank said in a statement that it has a broader definition of agricultural lending than the FDIC. In addition to farmers, the bank includes processors, food companies and other related business.FEDERAL BACKING FOR SMALLER BANKSThe decline in farm lending by the big banks has come despite ongoing growth in the farm-loan portfolios of the wider banking industry and in the government-sponsored Farm Credit System. But overall growth has slowed considerably, which banking experts called a sign that all lenders are growing more cautious about the sector.The four-quarter growth rate for farm loans at all FDIC-insured banks, which supply about half of all farm credit, slowed from 6.4% in December 2015 to 3.9% in March 2019. Growth in holdings of comparable farm loans in the Farm Credit System has also slowed.Many smaller, rural banks are more dependent on their farm lending portfolios than the national banks because they have few other options for lending in their communities. As farming towns have seen populations shrink, so have the number of businesses, said Curt Everson, president of the South Dakota Bankers Association.""All you have are farmers and companies that work with, sell to or buy from farmers,"" Everson said.As the perils have grown, some smaller banks have turned to the federal government for protection, tapping a U.S. Department of Agriculture program that guarantees up to 95% of a loan as a way to help rural and community banks lend to higher-risk farmers.Big Wall Street banks have steadily trimmed their farm portfolios since 2015 after boosting their lending in the sector in the wake of the financial crisis.Capital One Financial Corp'sfarm-loan holdings at FDIC-insured units fell 33% between the end of 2015 and March 2019. U.S. Bancorp'sshrunk by 25%.Capital One Financial Corp did not respond to requests for comment. U.S. Bancorp declined to comment.The agricultural loan holdings at BB&T Corphave fallen 29% since peaking in the summer of 2016 at $1.2 billion. PNC Financial Services Group Inc- which ran full-page ads in farm trade magazines promoting ""access to credit"" during the run-up - has cut its farm loans by 12% since 2015.BB&T said in a statement that the decline in its agricultural lending portfolio ""is largely due to aggressive terms and pricing"" offered by competitors and its ""conservative and disciplined"" approach to risk.PNC said its farm-loan growth is being held back by customers who are wary of taking new debt, along with increased competition from the Farm Credit System.LOAN DEMAND STILL RISINGLenders are avoiding mounting risks in a category that is not core to their business, said Curt Hudnutt, head of rural banking for Rabobank North America, a major farm lender and subsidiary of Dutch financial giant Rabobank Group.In March of this year, FDIC-insured banks reported that 1.53% of their farm loans were at least 90 days past due or had stopped accruing interest because the lender has doubts it will be repaid. This so-called noncurrent rate had doubled from 0.74% at the end of 2015. GRAPHIC:The noncurrent rates were far higher on the farm loans of some big Wall Street banks. Bank of America Corp's noncurrent rate for farm loans at its FDIC-insured units has surged to 4.1% from 0.6% at the end of 2015. Meanwhile, the bank has cut the value of its farm-loan portfolio by about a quarter over the same period, from $3.32 billion to $2.47 billion, according to the most recent FDIC data.Bank of Americadeclined to comment on the data or its lending decisions.For PNC Financial Services, the noncurrent rate was nearly 6% as of the end of March. It cut its farm-loan portfolio to $278.4 million, down from $317.3 million at the end of 2015.David Oppedahl, senior business economist for the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said the banking community is increasingly aware of how many farmers are struggling.""They don't want to be the ones caught holding bad loans,"" he said.","Stocks,WorldMarkets,401k,BankingandLoans,Politics,Retirement","BAC","[{'news_title': 'Where Will Netflix Be in 5 Years?', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/where-will-netflix-be-in-5-years-cm1175063', '_id': {'$oid': '5d2759a983ce4594f6023e66'}}, {'news_title': 'Your Step-by-Step Financial Plan for Moving Away From Home', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/your-step-by-step-financial-plan-for-moving-away-from-home-cm1175064', '_id': {'$oid': '5d2759a983ce4594f6023e67'}}, {'news_title': 'ALK Crosses Below Key Moving Average Level', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/alk-crosses-below-key-moving-average-level-cm1175055', '_id': {'$oid': '5d2759a983ce4594f6023e68'}}]","{'$date': '2019-07-11T06:00:00Z'}"

At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire owned shares of 10 different banks, and these positions have a current market value of more than $91 billion.However, we just learned that Buffett and his team have added even more to the company's largest bank-stock investment, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) . In fact, Berkshire's latest Bank of America stock purchase pushes the stake past the 10% ownership threshold. Here's why that's such a big deal.Image source: The Motley Fool.In a recent SEC filing, Bank of America disclosed that Berkshire Hathaway owns 950 million shares of the bank. This is significantly higher than the approximately 896.2 million shares it owned at the end of the first quarter.At the current stock price, the additional 53.8 million shares Berkshire has purchased translates to an additional $1.64 billion invested in what was already the company's largest bank-stock investment. Berkshire's Bank of America stake is now worth about $29 billion, still well behind tech giant Apple, Berkshire's largest investment with a $51.7 billion market value, but a firm second place in front of Coca-Cola, a $21.2 billion investment.Here's why this is so important. Thanks to a combination of the increased Berkshire investment and Bank of America's aggressive share buybacks, Berkshire Hathaway now owns 10.4% of the bank's outstanding shares.The 10% ownership level is significant, especially when it comes to banks. In the past, Buffett has actively avoided owning more than 10% of most of his bank stocks -- even selling significant amounts of Wells Fargo stock to remain under this threshold. Without going too deep into the implications of owning more than 10% of a bank, the point is that Buffett's willingness to deal with additional regulatory headaches in order to own a bigger piece of Bank of America shows extreme confidence in the stock.A look at Bank of America's recent resultsshows why Buffett might be especially eager to invest. For one thing, Bank of America is doing a better job of growing than the rest of the big banks.Bank of America's loan portfolio and deposit base grew by 4% and 6%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2019 on a year-over-year basis. The second-highest loan growth among the ""big four"" U.S. banks was just 2%.Furthermore, Bank of America has done a fantastic job of improving efficiency and continues to increase its profitability. The bank's 11.6% return on equity (ROE) and 1.23% return on assets (ROA) would have seemed ludicrous just a few years ago.From a value-investor's standpoint, Bank of America looks like a bargain. At just 1.15 times book value and 10.8 times trailing-12-month earnings, Bank of America is performing well and continues to improve, but the improvements haven't been reflected in the stock price.To be clear, the only reason we know about Berkshire's latest Bank of America investment is because it caused the 10% ownership threshold to be exceeded. In recent quarters, Berkshire has added to several of its bank stock investments, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, just to name a couple.Since Berkshire isn't even close to a 10% ownership stake with these and several other bank investments, when Berkshire's next 13-F filing is available in mid-August, it's entirely possible that we'll discover that Bank of America isn't the only bank stock Warren Buffett has been buying recently.10 stocks we like better than Berkshire Hathaway (B shares) When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Kline, Motley Fool","https://www.nasdaq.com/author/fool","The heat of summer causes people to hit the road in search of beaches, pools, theme parks, or maybe just a change of scenery. It's a season of good weather (or at least warm weather), the kids are off from school, and many adults use that as an excuse to take a trip.Last summer, the average American spent $812 on travel, $551 on restaurants, and $268 on entertainment, according to data compiled for The Motley Fool from Bank of America's credit and debit card customers. That's up 5% from 2017. The overall number of transactions rose by 9%, but the average transaction price decreased by 3% to $94.""Summer is here. For some that means sending your 'out-of-office' email and jetting off to relaxation,"" said Jason Gaughin, Bank of America's credit cards executive in a quote sent to The Motley Fool. ""For others, it's mapping out rooftop restaurants or giving your house a fresh coat of paint. Regardless of how you maximize warm weather, your wallet is likely to take a hit - as the average customer spent nearly $2,000 on travel, dining, and home improvement during last year's summer months.""A lot of Americans plan to travel this summer. Image source: Getty Images.In 2018, road travel saw a major increase. Gas spending increased by 22%, while consumers spent 29% more on rideshares than they did in 2017. Spending on air travel also jumped by 9% compared to the previous year. The average consumer spent $417 on gas and $151 on ride-sharing services.Spending on travel also varies by generation. Older travelers (65+), spent the most (an average of $731) on home shares than any other generation. That's more than that age group spent on hotels ($663). Millennials and Generation Z also spent more on home shares ($536 average for the two groups combined) than hotels ($401). Generation X, however, averaged $692 spent on hotels while baby boomers spent $709.""Millennials and GenX stayed true to the label 'foodies,' spending an average of $627 and $635 on restaurants, respectively,"" according to Bank of America. ""Meanwhile, baby boomers and seniors spent more than $100 less than their younger peers, at $474 and $354, respectively.""Summer travel does not have to break your budget. You may want to take a dream trip to Hawaii or hit another tropical island, but you may only have enough money to buy little umbrellas for drinks you make yourself.In reality, you can have fun wherever you are for nearly any budget. If you can only afford a local trip, work on making that fun. Most communities have beaches, lakes, pools, or other places to relax and people often don't take the time to do touristy things where they live.Even if your budget only allows for a plastic pool in the backyard, try to have fun within your budget. Remember that it's people and experiences -- not fancy travel -- you'll ultimately remember. Focus on making the most of what you can afford and try to be responsible even if you're tempted not to be.The $16,728 Social Security bonus most retirees completely overlook If you're like most Americans, you're a few years (or more) behind on your retirement savings. But a handful of little-known ""Social Security secrets"" could help ensure a boost in your retirement income. For example: one easy trick could pay you as much as $16,728 more... each year!

In 2007, before the global financial crisis took hold, the shares peaked at above 90 euros.'LOST OUR COMPASS'Earlier this year, the German government pushed for Deutsche to merge with cross-town rival Commerzbank to stabilise the lender. But the talks failed, leading Deutsche to announce its major revamp and corporate push last month.Sewing recognises Deutsche has lost ground but is determined to press on with his strategy to make the bank the go-to institution for company treasurers and to help more German companies become global powerhouses.""This is the business Deutsche Bank was founded for, however, we have to admit that we lost our compass in the last two decades,"" Sewing said in July. ""Now we will make the business stronger than ever before.""Deutsche plans to merge its corporate banking businesses across various divisions into one large unit, and target mid-sized German firms, known as the Mittelstand, as well as blue-chips.Michael Schleef, Deutsche's head of corporate banking in Germany, told Reuters there had been a 58% increase in incoming orders since Oct. 1, though he declined to give details. Calls and visits to clients were up 50% per banker after years of stagnation and the feedback was ""very positive"", he said.Deutsche is also planning to expand in new markets in eastern Europe and Southeast Asia, he said. ""We aren't feeling any uncertainty from clients.""Mittelstand companies are the backbone of the German economy but have long felt neglected by Deutsche, turning to smaller rivals instead. Mario Ohoven, president of a federal association of Mittelstand companies, said a lot will depend on whether Deutsche approaches them as a partner, or an arrogant banker.A big problem for Deutsche as it embarks on the new strategy is that it has been slipping down the German league tables.So far this year, Deutsche has been absent from several major deals involving German firms. When chipmaker Infineon Technologiesbought America's Cypress Semiconductorfor $10 billion - the biggest overseas deal by a German company in 2019 - it was advised by Credit Suisse , Bank of Americaand JPMorgan.In the ranking for fees from mergers and takeovers involving German companies this year, Deutsche has slipped to sixth place, according to data from Dealogic. Deutsche had ranked among the top five banks since at least 2000, often in top spot.Deutsche has slipped down the table for syndicated loans for German companies too, according to Dealogic. It still ranks first for their bond issues but its market share has plunged by two-thirds since 2000, the data shows.Deutsche also dropped to sixth place from fifth in league tables for transaction banking between 2016 and 2018, according to Coalition, which analyses the banking industry.And in a sign companies are spreading their business around more, 22 out of 27 German companies active in deals awarded a smaller share of fees to their primary bank over the past five years than in the previous five years, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data.'LONG JOURNEY'The intensified competition at home is epitomised by the case of Duerr , a 120-year-old company that makes factory equipment for the auto industry.In 2014, Duerr counted Deutsche among its seven main banks for a syndicated loan. In a new agreement this month, Deutsche is now one of 13, a wider circle that includes Bank of China , Dutch bank ING , and JPMorgan.""Nobody puts all eggs in one basket,"" said Christian Aue, a vice president for corporate finance and treasury at Duerr.Andreas Thomae of fund manager Deka, which is a large investor in Deutsche, said: ""It is now extremely important for the bank that corporate customers accept the new strategy.""""It will be interesting to see whether it can increase earnings in the division as planned. This will be a long journey,"" he said.As Zalando turned down Deutsche's offer, its bankers tried to assuage the company's misgivings, Kilka-Roth said, but to no avail.Deutsche Bank declined to comment on Zalando.The bank's own data suggests Zalando is not the only corporate with doubts. Companies started reducing cash stored with Deutsche several years ago as the bank's woes mounted, according to data from the bank's annual report.Company deposits, which primarily come from Deutsche's transaction business, fell 8% between 2015 and 2018.Narrower measures of short-term deposits from big customers - excluding deposits from banks and companies doing transaction banking such as cross-border payments - show an even steeper fall. Deposits with a maturity of less than a year, for example, fell 32% between 2015 and 2018.Deutsche Bank disputed any suggestion the decline in deposits was related to customer concerns about the bank.Instead, the drop is the result of an effort by Deutsche to convert deposits from large corporations into alternative investments to avoid negative interest rates charged by the European Central Bank, a Deutsche Bank spokesman said.Deposits from smaller corporate clients have risen by double digits over the past three years, he said.'COMPLETE CONFIDENCE'Regulators say the bank is on firmer footing than in 2016 when they feared it was on the brink of collapse after it became public it would have to pay a multi-billion dollar fine for its role in the U.S. mortgage crisis.Then, some of Germany's top industrial companies discussed taking a symbolic stake in Deutsche Bank to help it through its turmoil. But no action was taken.Sewing, who became CEO last year, would now like to welcome anchor investors from corporate Germany, according to someone who has spoken with him. Deutsche declined to comment.It is unclear how widespread Zalando's stance is in Germany because few firms speak publicly about banking relationships.RWE'sfinance chief Markus Krebber, for example, told Reuters the German energy company had ""complete confidence in the strength and performance of Deutsche Bank and see it on the right path under its initiated restructuring"".Deutsche's corporate banking business already accounts for 5 billion euros in annual revenue, according to the bank's calculations. Sewing said it should be able to increase that to 6 billion euros by 2022, ""not by doing rocket science, but by simply reaping low hanging fruit"".He pointed to the fact the bank already had relationships with all 30 companies in Germany's main DAX stock market index .""In the first half of 2019 alone, we facilitated payments worth more than 100 trillion euros,"" Sewing said in July.A recent survey from the consultancy Bain & Company, however, found revenues and profitability in the corporate banking sector are the lowest in Germany since the financial crisis due to increased competition.""When we talk to our clients, they have very aggressive plans in the corporate banking space this year,"" said Christian Graf, the report's author and consultant to the banking industry.($1 = 0.8924 euros)GRAPHIC-Deutsche Bank's declining market share for German M&AGRAPHIC-Deutsche Bank loses ground in German company bonds and loansGRAPHIC-Companies' deposits drop at Deutsche Bank","Politics,Stocks,WorldMarkets,Economy,Technology","BAC","[{'news_title': '3 Top Diabetes Stocks to Watch in August', 'news_link': 'https://www.nasdaq.com/article/3-top-diabetes-stocks-to-watch-in-august-cm1201153', '_id': {'$oid': '5d5d52f983ce4541f86f671f'}}, {'news_title': 'This Is Not 2008.
